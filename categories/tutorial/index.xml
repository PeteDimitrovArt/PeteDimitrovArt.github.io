&lt;p&gt;There are many reason as to why a game project or a prototype could have low performance. In order to find the source of the trouble, one needs to profile both their CPU and their GPU intensive processes. Different things we do in an engine, mechanics or visuals that we implement can end up on the CPU or on the GPU. We could have a perfect performance on one of those, but if the other one is lacking, we will be negatively bound to it. That is what we mean when we try to analyze whether we are &lt;strong&gt;CPU-bound&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;GPU-bound&lt;/strong&gt; in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many student&amp;rsquo;s projects that are not supposed to be mechanically or visually complex, but simple and elegant on purpose. They are just blockouts of 3D spaces that are a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Level Design&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; exercise more than anything else. In their project, though, the student will still struggle with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mostly a sketch, level design blockout, yet the FPS is low. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Old screenshot from an UE4 project from my university days. It depicts a space station on the surface of what seems to be a satellite. All of the meshes are blockout pieces and have gray, placeholder textures. I had set up some of the floor plates as blueprints and as such I had messed up my draw calls.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;culprits&#34;&gt;Culprits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons that could cause the issues. One would need to in detail profile their project in order to find the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to student works though, there are some culprits that I often see repeated again and again. As such we could make an educated guess and say that, as a student, the project you are working in right now, might have exactly one of those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those four main reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking out using BSP Brushes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking out by making blueprint actors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a loot item that has an animation on the CPU;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using lots of overlapping lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three are actually the same issue, disguised differently. That is the problem of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;draw calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. We will look into that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-engines&#34;&gt;Game Engines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples we show in this blog are mostly in UE5. If we were doing things in UE4 the situation would be nearly identical. Nanite in UE5 handles draw calls better than UE4 but most of the explanations I mention as culprits for low performance cannot be fully alleviated by Nanite. As such the issue persists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my student days, I didn&amp;#39;t know about a lot of these tech issues that I&amp;#39;m about to describe here. I learned about the culprits and how to resolve them back in my first industry job. It was an indie game dev studio. In there, I actually worked in Unity. Even though Unity can be quite different from UE5 in some aspects, lots of the fundamentals are the same. If you are learning and working with Unity right now, you would still benefit from reading this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-explored&#34;&gt;Issues Explored:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;draw-calls&#34;&gt;Draw Calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue that I most often find in students projects is mismanagement of draw calls. This one is so prevalent that I think it can be found often in indie projects out there too. Those are projects that are done by experienced people who might not have found good ways to manage their draw calls yet either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw calls is a topic that is not very often discussed at universities and schools either. As such it creeps as a mistake in so many game prototypes &lt;em&gt;(and some finished, released games too)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Draw call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A draw call is a request going through the CPU, that will inform the GPU what object to render and how to render it. The request comes with a bundle of information like position, scale, material IDs, material usage and more. It can be for a single object or a batch of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In larger game companies, knowledge and experience flows freely, and as such when it comes to their games there will often be people, or custom tools, that will directly optimize and look at the draw calls footprint through the different stages of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way most engines work is through common and easy tactics that when applied will have your many objects on the screen end up in batches of draw calls. That way the scene gets optimized and the number of draw calls is controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to always keep our draw calls amount low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some things you might do that will hardly ever batch. Those things will skyrocket your draw calls amount:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bsp-brushes&#34;&gt;BSP Brushes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One case study for an easy way to skyrocket your draw calls (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thats very bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) in both UE5 and UE4 is through the usage of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BSP Brushes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few example screenshots from my environment project &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-014/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;2018&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-call-tip-004.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from UE4 where an environment scene is seen in its early stages. It showcases a Japanese shrine in the style of Izumo-taisha (Izumo Grand Shrine).There are multiple levels of height and lots of wooden structures blocked out in gray and green checkerboard materials.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the image above, my project is in early blockout. I love doing my measurements and shapes exploration for the different buildings through BSP brushes. But there is a giant drawback to using BSP brushes. If I am not careful and aware of it, I could easily create a larger blockout that then has incredibly poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the things seen above, but suddenly duplicated many times and blocking out a level that is few kilometers wider, instead of the smaller section of level seen above. The poor performance created by the BSPs will then even be exponentially higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-call-tip-005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;2484&#34;
	height=&#34;1397&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another screenshot from the same UE4 project as in the image before. This time the shot shows it in later dev stage. There are more finalized, wooden textured props. The layout has been improved too. There is grass and trees blockouts in the background. &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;, 2018.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the image above, we see a later dev stage where I have already replaced all of my BSP brushes for actual static geometry, created in Blender &lt;em&gt;(or Maya, which I used back in those years)&lt;/em&gt;. By replacing the BSPs, I fixed my performance. A lot of blockouts and students projects never get to a stage of replacing BSPs for static geo. That is understandable - the BSPs serve a perfect purpose and the level created is a level design blockout, not something that needs to have finished set dressing. It&amp;rsquo;s not wanted to replace the brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by not replacing the BSPs, we&amp;rsquo;ve left in the scene a type of actor that carries an incredibly high amount of draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Issue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes cary a lot of information in them that gives them their custom dimensions. For example, a parallelepiped is represented by the length of each of its sides. In the options of the BSP we can change any of those sizes dynamically. We are given lots of freedom for iteration. That freedom comes at the cost of draw calls. Each object has more than one draw call (due to the dimension options in it). Each object is unique too, which makes it impossible to batch any draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes can be baked down (also called merge). They can be converted into a finalized, static geometry, that cannot be dynamically changed in dimensions. Through that bake, the draw calls are reduced to low amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;merge-down-bsp-brushes&#34;&gt;Merge Down BSP Brushes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to win back our good performance, when using BSP brushes that we intend to keep in the level, is to bake down the BSPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step-by-step how-to for merging down BSPs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the BSP Actor that you want to turn into ordinary static geometry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the right hand menu, look in the &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; of the Brush component;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the location to save it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done. Engine does the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine will save a new static mesh that is in the shape of your BSP. It will also replace your old &amp;ldquo;Brush Component&amp;rdquo; for a &amp;ldquo;Static Mesh Actor&amp;rdquo; that has more efficient draw calls and is the result of the bake down we just did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The steps, illustrated:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-001.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;A screenshot from UE5. A blank level is seen with lots of checkerboard texture geometry primitives. A selection gizmo hovers over a selected, lowpoly, sphere. Yellow text on top points to the right side &amp;ldquo;Details panel&amp;rdquo; and us clicking on &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; then on &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text is transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the brush geo. Expand &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; tab. Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1503&#34;
	height=&#34;953&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same image as before but now there is a submenu that has popped up on the screen after pressing &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo; the first time around. This menu shows the project directory and asks us in what folder to save the geometry that we are about to create. Yellow text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select where to save. Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(blue button seen above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1503&#34;
	height=&#34;953&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical to before image but now the selection on the sphere has changed. On the right hand side, in the &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; panel the sphere is listed as a different component. Yellow text described below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that now your component type is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. We turned the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brush Component&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(has lots of draw calls)&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static Mesh Component&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(has manageable, lower amount of draw calls)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go over your scene and do that for each unique type of geometry shape you&amp;rsquo;ve created. After turning one shape into a static geometry, replace any other BSPs visually similar to it for the newly created static geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proof&#34;&gt;Proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we jumped to the solution above, without me presenting any evidence. Lets say that before you went through all of the ordeal of merging and baking down your geometry, you wanted to see proof that indeed BSP brushes are as bad as I describe them to be. Here is some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cmd&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to see some evidence is to analyze the draw calls amounts on a screen at a given time and compare it to the same screen but with some of the &amp;ldquo;static mesh&amp;rdquo; actors swapped instead for &amp;ldquo;BSP brush&amp;rdquo; actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we expect to see, given all of the reasoning I went through so far, is that the &amp;ldquo;static mesh&amp;rdquo; actors filled screen will be low on draw calls. The screen filled with &amp;ldquo;BSP brush&amp;rdquo; actors instead will be incredibly high on draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do exactly that by using the console command seen above, inside Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/cmd-001.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;An image of a blank scene in UE5. The left side of the editor UI is seen. An arrow points to the lower part where &amp;ldquo;Content Drawer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Output Log&amp;rdquo; are. Next to them is a &amp;ldquo;CMD&amp;rdquo;. There is a black bar that says &amp;ldquo;Enter Console Command&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text says to click on it to start typing.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;90&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;217px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the cmd seen above and start typing. Write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then hit &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. A profiling window in green colors will show up on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/cmd-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1325&#34;
	height=&#34;1150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot of a screen identical to before (blank UE5 scene). This time, we&amp;rsquo;ve typed into the cmd and a profiling screen has popped up on top. Lots of green text describes different stats. By the bottom, in &amp;ldquo;Counters&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;Present time - 5.40ms&amp;rdquo; there is &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls - average 13.23 and max 53.00&amp;rdquo;. Orange arrow points to that and yellow text says &amp;ldquo;Lots of useful stats here but what we are after right now is this line. Mesh draw calls.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;115&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;276px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve circled the line above which we are after on this newly popped up &amp;ldquo;Scene Rendering&amp;rdquo; profiling screen. We can see that Mesh draw calls are max 53.00 and min 5.00. That is expectedly low amount given that right now our camera frustum (viewing frustum) is looking at a mostly empty corner of the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at a part of the screen with some static meshes and BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-001.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1010&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A screenshot of a mostly empty, default UE5 scene. There is a checkerboard floor, a blue sky, a yellow bench and 3 geometric solid primitives colored in white.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;365px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above showcases a scene with a few assets of type &amp;ldquo;Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1539&#34;
	height=&#34;1011&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image that is the same, previously empty scene, but now on top of the screen are overlaid stats from scene rendering. Lots of green text with lots of important information. In this case we are looking at &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls - average 19.92 and max 29.99&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;365px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we do &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; on the screen we see that the mesh draw calls of this scene are low. Average of 19.92 and max of 29.00 (&lt;em&gt;seen above&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-003.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1012&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image of the same camera angle as before. Now next to the orange bench are added lots more geometry primitives. Those are cubes, cones, polyhedrons. They are all shaded in dark gray checkerboard texture. They are all BSP brush actor types.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;364px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, in image above, we add a bunch of BSP brush actor types to the scene. Those are in the form of various geometry primitives but the important part is that they are BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The same camera angle as before but now most of the geometry is hidden under the green text stats scene. Looking at the &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls&amp;rdquo; line of it tells us that average draw calls are 951.62 and maximum are 1,916.00.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we again do &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; on the screen above, we see that now our draw calls have sky-rocketed. On average they are 951.62 and on max they even go as high as 1,916.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large number, as explained already, is due to the BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;An image that looks at the same angle as before but now its a collage of four similar images. Image one, (a), is a close up of the orange bench and the BSP brushes next to it. Image two, (b), showcases the stats of that scene. Image three, (c), looks identical to image (a) but now the BSP brushes have been converted to static meshes. Image four, (d), looks at the stats of image (c) and it shows how they are exponentially lower than before. The numbers are transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final figure, we have top row images &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt;, consisting of the scene full of BSP Brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bottom row, images &lt;strong&gt;(c)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(d)&lt;/strong&gt;, we have used the technique described in this blog post and have turned the BSP brushes actors into static meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visuals between &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(c)&lt;/strong&gt; are identical. Yet the scene in &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; that had BSP brushes has average of 951.62 draw calls. The scene with only static meshes, seen in &lt;strong&gt;(d)&lt;/strong&gt;, has 82.48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion from comparison above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes, as seen above introduce lots of needless draw calls. Keep your level blockouts and your environment art scenes free of them by converting to static meshes and your performance will be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;short-explanation&#34;&gt;Short explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you intend to use some geometry as static? Did you turn it into a blueprint because you wanted to attach something else that is static to it?
If yes, then turning it into a blueprint might have turned it into &amp;ldquo;movable&amp;rdquo; geometry that then has increased draw calls and can&amp;rsquo;t bundle in draw calls with instances (&lt;em&gt;copies in the level&lt;/em&gt;) of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;A screenshot from inside a Blueprint window inside Unreal 5. The crop shows a part of the &amp;ldquo;Details Panel&amp;rdquo;. It focuses on &amp;ldquo;Transform&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; settings under it. An arrow points at &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; and says &amp;ldquo;Bad!&amp;rdquo; We should use &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; instead.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;245&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;589px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, go into the newly made blueprint with static art set dressings and make sure you set the root and the children geometry inside all as &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;. All solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;long-explanation&#34;&gt;Long explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Blueprints is a smart thing to do. It definitely is the right approach no matter if you are doing level design, mechanics or environment art and set dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though a lot of people who start in Unreal for the first time might not see the use of Blueprints past gameplay and mechanics, there is in fact lots to extract from blueprints when doing set dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making environment art, it can sometimes be slow to work directly into the world, in world space. You create a building and it is placed at an odd angle in the level. Every set dressing that might go onto its exterior, on its façade, you need to place at a similarly odd angle. An easier way to work instead would be to create &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;local space&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A bundle of assets - the buildings and its façade set dressings - placed in its own coordinates. That is exactly a blueprint. That &amp;ldquo;local space&amp;rdquo; bundle, then like a little template can be placed in the world, at an odd angle. It&amp;rsquo;s creation, through a blueprint, instead of directly working in &amp;ldquo;world space&amp;rdquo; was much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Below I made a silly looking house as a quick example. Ignore the fact it doesn&amp;#39;t look amazing. I used Unreal starter project meshes with the idea of illustrating the explanations here a bit better.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-001.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from a blank level. In the middle are two identical houses. Left is just meshes in the world, right is meshes that are inside a blueprint instead. A yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;In this pic I&amp;rsquo;ve selected each asset individually. Each asset is placed on its own, and its own odd angle.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;206&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;495px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working with multiple people and there is version control, this means you don&amp;rsquo;t need to commit changes to the world (the level) next time you want to improve the building. Instead you can edit the blueprint (the local space) and commit that change. The fixes and improvements will automatically propagate to every level where the blueprint was used.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Image identical to before but now the right side house is selected. The one that is a blueprint. An arrow points at the outliner that showcases the assets are not loose anymore but in a bundle. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Second asset selected here is a Blueprint instead. Actors are bundled in a template that is easier to select and move.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this paints a picture of why its &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to work with blueprints in order to build &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;templates&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of environment art and set dressing. In the image below is seen one such template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from a Blueprint editing window in Unreal 5. It showcases the house and all its set dressings bundled together. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Editing the art in a &amp;ldquo;mini scene&amp;rdquo; like this is much easier tha editing inside the world level.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, here comes the issue though, and the reason why you might have low performance next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-004.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image like before but now an arrow points to the &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; settings and yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;The template came with default settings through. Those settings are wrong for the use case (environment art set dressing).&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen above, the default settings when making a blueprint will set every static geometry inside to &amp;ldquo;movable&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo;. As mentioned before, that increases draw calls. It&amp;rsquo;s also needless, as these pieces will be used as environment art that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever move. We can fix it all by changing the mobility back to static, as seen in the next images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical to before UE5 blueprint editor screenshot. An orange arrow points to &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; and crosses over &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;, explains that &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; is the correct one. The text is described in the next paragraph.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow text above reads &amp;ldquo;We need to change the mobility from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. This way draw calls will be manageable. In this step we changed the root and next we need to also change the mobility of any meshes under it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-006.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image from the same blueprint. On the left side, in the &amp;ldquo;Components&amp;rdquo; window, in blue are selected lots of children static meshes. Another arrow on the right hand side points again to &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; this time of the selected many children assets. Yellow text is described below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above instructs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we should select all children under the root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we change their &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; as well. A yellow arrow points to where to do that in the blueprint details panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the blueprint file changes and all is done. We are now all optimized on draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all set to static, all is good and manageable in draw calls. Always pay attention to your mobility settings for new Blueprints and you will not have further performance issues related to the BPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-drops-and-loot&#34;&gt;Moving Drops and Loot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve created a little game prototype. It consists mostly of blockout levels without any heavy graphics. You are a person interested in level design, as well as game design for gameplay mechanics and gameplay systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your game prototype world is just the mentioned above: blockouts. You have also added some enemies and simple loot that spawns when the minions die. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve also scattered and placed some predefined collectables in your level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a collectable to be easily spotted by the player, and for it to look interesting and like we could interact with it, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give it a simple animation. Something like the rotation around main pivot point, as seen by the colorful, little gems in Spyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/spyro-gems.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from one of the cave levels in Spyro Reignited Trilogy. To the front of the camera is Spyro. Next to him are a green and a blue gem. In the background there is a large spider and to the right of it are two more gems. Those are red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You like rewarding players and giving them sense of satisfaction and progression. As such you shower them in loot. Soon the level you have is packed with lots and lots of rotating in place items. Your FPS is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of the above is the case, and if indeed your performance is low, then the reason might be exactly in the loot. More specifically, in the way you did the simple animation associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you could approach making this animation. One is through a Blueprint Actor that has moving component that gives the item a rotation on each game tick through the blueprint logic. The second way is through a custom material shader (&lt;em&gt;Material Graph&lt;/em&gt;) that rotates the loot through World Position Offset. There is also a third way, through an animation created in Blender or Maya and imported, but we will ignore that because most students and devs will prefer to do something as simple as rotation around pivot inside the engine itself, instead of going outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your FPS to be down, you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely picked the first option. You&amp;rsquo;ve created your loot as a blueprint that gets placed in a static location in the world. That blueprint then has the logic to rotate the item around, or make it hover up and down. By doing it through the blueprint you&amp;rsquo;ve inadvertently increased your draw calls by causing each placed instance of the loot to be a unique draw call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The culprit here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make the item animate through a blueprint, you set the geometry to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; game object always ends up in its own draw call;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce hundreds of those. They wont stack into one draw call, they will be hundreds of draw calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead you animate the object through the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material Graph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Position Offset (WPO)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; then your animation will end up being on the GPU. All objects using the material that animates them could be left to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and still visually animate in movement. All of those objects would then bundle in draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would no longer be making hundreds and hundreds of needless draw calls that slow down your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your performance will increase. Your FPS will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Title is &#34;Rotating Objects in UE4, Benchmarked (Get better FPS!)&#34; by YouTuber &#34;Pending Kill&#34;. The video is an excellent showcase of how one could do the different types of animation and what their performance would be.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video is the best showcase, and explanation, of everything I wrote above. I found it some time ago randomly and was very impressed by the great presentation in it. Give it a watch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showcase is in UE4 but the inner workings are the same in UE5. As such if you found yourself making rotating loot, all of this info is still valid. It&amp;rsquo;s also the same way in Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overlapping-lights&#34;&gt;Overlapping Lights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect that can be incredibly influential over your performance is light. Depending on how you use &amp;ldquo;Point Lights&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Spotlights&amp;rdquo; in your project, you might end up with a lot of overlaps in light that increase the cost of the light actors and drag down your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter if we are in UE5, UE4 or Unity, we need to be careful with movable, overlapping lights, and we need to be intelligent with the way we place those actors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to always keep overlaps in lights low. Light actors should be placed with sensible attenuation radius and should not be stacked over one another, even when they have small radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lights-example&#34;&gt;Lights Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are talking about lighting that is realistic and looks cinematic and moody, the general artistic comment of &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo; is even stronger than other mediums of art. As such, if we set up lighting in a smart way, we will get a better artistic visual through using less amount of point lights and spotlights. That will then result in better performance too, thanks to the already mentioned reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lets explore some visual examples of lights overlapping. For that I will take a look at my project &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  title=&#34;_index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;check the link to read about its making!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the comparison images above we first see the final scene. The secondary screenshot overlays on top the billboards of the lights, showcasing their position in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If with the UE5 scene open, we click on the viewport and then we press &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;ALT + 7&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; on the keyboard, we will go into &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. That is an &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization Viewmode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. In the secondary image below, we can see lots of blue, green and red colors. That&amp;rsquo;s the light complexity view mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;First is the image seen before - the UE5 scene with the crystal, 2D sprites showing lights toggled. Second image on top is a -Light Complexity- view mode. It shows the scene in flat silhouettes. Those are colored between deep blue, green, yellow, orange, red and purple and white. Each color corresponds to a complexity in the light, dragging performance down. Transcription to what each color represents is in the following paragraph below.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legend of how to read the view mode comes in the form of the long, color gradient bar in the lower parts of the screen. It reads as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep blues to light blues - little overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green to yellow - medium overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in flashy, absolutely needless, colors that I spend way too long writing code for, given that I will probably never reuse in the future of this blog &lt;em&gt;(I mean, behold how ugly it is!)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom0&#34;&gt;1. Deep blues to light blues - little overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom1&#34;&gt;2. Green to yellow - medium overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .gradient-text {
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    .gradient-text-custom3 {
        background: linear-gradient(to right, #f66703, #a90019 50%);
        -webkit-background-clip: text;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom3&#34;&gt;3. Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .gradient-text {
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    .gradient-text-custom4 {

        -webkit-background-clip: text;
        color: transparent;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom4&#34;&gt;4. Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger amount of lights affecting a surface (&lt;em&gt;overlapping there&lt;/em&gt;), the more expensive to render that surface becomes. The colors indicate that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue - surface only affected by your Directional Light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green - surface affected by your Dir Light + one more light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red - surface affected by up to 5 different lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are working on our lighting set up, we want to check this light complexity view mode from time to time. That is in order to track if we get big &amp;ldquo;offenders&amp;rdquo; in overlapping lights. If we see any, we want to select the light and under its settings tweak the &amp;ldquo;Attenuation Radius&amp;rdquo; down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gif below, we can see me doing exactly that with two point lights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/amarantos-lights-anim.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;Frame gif animation. Shows a camera angle facing one of the corners of the Amarantos Ritual environment. There are lots of roots and props seen in the first frame. Second frame shows billboards of lights on top. Third frame switches to &amp;ldquo;Light Complexity&amp;rdquo; type of &amp;ldquo;Optimization Viewmode&amp;rdquo;. All the colors go from dark blue to red to white, each indicating bad light complexity through light overlaps.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;364px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how in the middle of the gif above playing, when spectating the optimization view mode, the colors change from purples and whites to bit more reds. That is the frame where I selected two Point Lights. They had &amp;ldquo;Attenuation Radius&amp;rdquo; setting of 300. I toned them down to a radius of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you observe the change between the final frame and the first one, you see before-and-after. Indeed there is a difference in how the lighting looks. But the lesson here is that there are lots of situation in which you might needlessly have a large amount of attenuation radius. If you go into the setting and dial it down slowly, you might see that the first many numbers you go down through might not change the visual at all. But in the background, it will change the overlap in light and it will optimize your scene further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lights-art-control&#34;&gt;Lights Art Control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets mention the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; part again though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out once more, that when we have less amount of lights in a scene, they are actually artistically easier to direct and control. As such a well lit, moody and beautiful scene, will more often be build up of the elegance of a few large lights, as opposed to a constellation of many tiny lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep that in mind and study movies and cinematic direction in order to learn how to see the simplicity and elegance of use of light in broad strokes, instead of tiny ones. That will make you better at lighting as art, but it will coincidentally make your scenes more optimized as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference is queen here so you always want to find good photographs and movie stills to base your lighting work off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;baked-lights&#34;&gt;Baked Lights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more old-fashioned lighting set up, where one relies on stationary lights that will be baked, overlapping lights might not be nearly as big of an issue. That set up is commonly seen in UE4 and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already explored, in a more modern lighting set up, where nearly all of the lights are movable and will not be baked at all, overlapping lights can have a detrimental affect on your performance. This lighting set up is what we most commonly see in UE5 and Lumen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you project is in UE5, if you are a student that is looking to expand their knowledge and find their first break into the industry, I would say that its worth looking up how to create good lightmaps for assets. Those lightmaps will then allow you, with the right settings, to bake most of your lights in your scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of next gen games that are build in UE5 don&amp;rsquo;t use baked lights. But lots of games still use baked lights (&lt;em&gt;for example most projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over at Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;). The technique is incredibly good and beneficial, with little drawbacks to the art and big wins in the performance, when done the right way. As such its something commonly found in lots of studios out there and you having some knowledge in it will put you ahead of a lot of other candidates that might compete with you in a job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;gpu-profiling-tool&#34;&gt;GPU Profiling Tool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see how well, or bad, your lights are performing directly into the GPU profiler tool that Unreal provides as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/gpu-profiler-001.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;UE5 screenshot from the scene seen before. This time around on top of the UI is overlaid a new window. It&amp;rsquo;s called GPU Visualizer and it lists a few things. One is &amp;ldquo;Scene&amp;rdquo; that is then followed by multi colored bar. Each color represents different cost. An orange annotation arrow points at a green section and a text annotation says &amp;ldquo;Press the green bar to see &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; info.&amp;rdquo;. Explanation how to open this entire window is in the paragraphs below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is incredibly beneficial as it lists the costs to anything that ends up on the GPU. In the cases where you know that your graphics are dragging you down, and that you might be GPU-bound, you can use that screen to analyze what needs improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the time we clicked the Unreal cmd in the lower left corner of the screen to type &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; we can now use it to instead call this GPU tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the cmd and type &amp;ldquo;Profile GPU&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;profile gpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then hit &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. The profiler window will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first image above, we can see that there is a long bar colored in different regions. Each of those represents a different cost that is on the GPU. Hovering over the teal-green colored section in my case, I saw that its listed as &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on that and it expanded into the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/gpu-profiler-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1344&#34;
	height=&#34;925&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same screenshot as before but now the teal-green section of the multi-color bar is highlighted. That has expanded a lower portion of the screen that lists &amp;ldquo;Lights &amp;ndash; Direct Lighting &amp;ndash; Unbatched Lights&amp;rdquo;. In there are lots of Point Lights. Each has a different cost listed as duration (ms) on the right side. Yellow text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting to take a closer look at the lights, we can see them listed in the category below. If the &lt;strong&gt;ms&lt;/strong&gt; listed in this category is very high, then the performance is bad and your FPS will be low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the lights, this tool allows you to nicely observe if there are other performance issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from an old project of mine is one time when I was having incredibly poor FPS. I ran the GPU Profiler Viz and I could see that the &amp;ldquo;Hair Groom&amp;rdquo; actors associated with my Metahuman in the scene was giving incredibly hard time to my GTX 1070. I disabled the hair, put a helmet on the metahuman, and started saving up for a newer gen GPU that could handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lengthy blog post, we explore common reasons for low performance in projects. That is in both environment art projects and level design blockouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at some ideas of how to handle and fix the issues. We explored draw calls, static meshes and BSP brushes. We looked at how to convert BSP brushes into static meshes that are more manageable in draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we looked at blueprints actors and how faulty default settings might cause high draw calls. From there we went into animating simple drop. Finally we explored lights and what overlapping lights are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling that we explored, like the &amp;ldquo;scenerendering&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GPU profiler&amp;rdquo; are incredibly powerful. I mentioned some ways to look at those and analyze your work. The screens list lots and lots more useful data though. It&amp;rsquo;s data that is too much to explore in a single blog post. As such I shall leave you to analyze and perfect your performance further by looking at all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thing that I would like to mention, that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get the time to cover in this post either, is that what we do in blueprints when it comes to scripting and to logic behind implementing gameplay, can of course, also affect performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such make sure you not only spend your energy profiling your graphics, but try to optimize and make sure the logic of your blueprints, code and gameplay is also well created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 09 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Five (Optional)</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos182-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 09 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Five (Optional)" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lets use a Blueprint Actor with extended Construction Script logic in order to improve our work practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have went through all four previous entries of this tutorial series. We have created the geometry, textures and then shaders necessary for getting the nice visual end result. We could leave it there. The VFX vision is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is one final, optional step I wanted to run you through. It&amp;rsquo;s the set up of a custom Blueprint Actor and a few lines of Construction Script node logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to remind yourself of the previous tutorial steps, you can do so over here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part One - Creating Static Geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Two - Creating Textures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Four - Adding Refraction Shader and Assembling The Final VFX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in all parts of this tutorial series, I am working in UE5.3. If you are inside UE4, you can still follow along and should not have any issues replicating any part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with what you have, you can skip this final part. If you want to learn more about Blueprints and Unreal, stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a reminded of what we have accomplished so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the visual result and the set up of our work so far. The VFX vortex basin looks cool. It looks how we wanted it. I have a &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; with a part of its set up that has nothing to do with the visuals though. I say &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; because its not a large issue per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more about efficiency than about any &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. There is an overall lack of efficiency that shows up in a few ways. Lets look over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-bundled&#34;&gt;Not Bundled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a started, our VFX basin is composed of four pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static vortex mesh with base color.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static vortex mesh copy with refraction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle small static mesh plane to fix imperfection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cylinder static mesh frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As such whenever I want to copy my visual into a new level, or make a duplicate in the existing level, I have to select all one by one, as seen in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos149.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1716&#34;
	height=&#34;982&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot of a scene. Four static meshes - plane, two vfx vortex basins and a cylinder are selected. That can be seen in the Hierarchy view on the right of the screen, where the pieces are selected in blue highlighter.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine a hypothetical situation where this asset is used in a full production game, where lots of artist work on the game. First, selecting one by one four assets, whenever you want to move things around is inefficient. Second, having to &amp;ldquo;instruct&amp;rdquo; and have other artists remember about your edge case VFX where its split into four pieces is also quite inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to that. It is to turn the four pieces into a bundle. Into a Blueprint Actor. We will do that and cover the necessary steps. Any artist, designer or a programmer that later on has to work with this VFX basin, add functionality or do tweaks, will be thankful to us for bundling it properly into an actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-to-change-color&#34;&gt;Hard to Change Color&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember from the previous steps, we made our main material shader so we can tint the VFX into any color we like. That is the reason why in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; of the tutorial series we left the &amp;ldquo;albedo&amp;rdquo; liquid-spill texture black and white - so we could tint it in engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, lets imagine another hypothetical situation with a game in full production. Let us say that this VFX basin is used as a portal or as some fundamental for gameplay function. As such it will exist everywhere. Lots of copies in each world. Also lets say that for visual variety, or even better, for design functionality, we have created a big array of lots of colored versions of this VFX basin. Its not going to be just blue, purple and green like the previews above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead its going to be blue, purple, green, violet, pink, red, yellow, cyan, a shade of black, a shade of white, and more. Also lets imagine that new artists or designers joining might want newer shades of colors, so they suddenly create even more. Our Content Browser ends up like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos150.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1603&#34;
	height=&#34;412&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the Content Drawer (project directory) of UE5. 9 files are visible which have similar icons but are all different colors. Those are 9 copies of the same material instance - the polar coordinates from the previous blog parts - tinted in all kinds of hues.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;389&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;933px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the patience to make only 9 material instances to illustrate this point. But imagine there being 18, or 25 or even 30 material instances. Believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen productions at previous game dev jobs I&amp;rsquo;ve had where this thing happens. I didn&amp;rsquo;t name the instances properly either - instead of having a color in the name, they just go _Inst1&amp;hellip;Inst2&amp;hellip;InstN. and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that in studios out there too &lt;em&gt;(make sure to always name things properly)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make something more efficient and eliminate the two issues above, we can create a Blueprint Actor. In it, all static meshes will be into a collection, which fixes problem one. Then in the Construction Script of the blueprint, we can use few nodes of logic in order to make it so we have exposed and customizable color per blueprint actor instance once placed in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will end up with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos151.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;1153&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 blueprint actor inspection screen image. In the middle, in the 3D viewport, we can see the VFX basin meshes. If we look at the left side of the screen, we can see all 4 static meshes are listed. If we look at the right side, we will see a &amp;ldquo;Base Color&amp;rdquo; tinted in blue. That controls the color per actor instance basis, dynamically.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;399px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blueprint-actor&#34;&gt;Blueprint Actor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your project directory, make a folder called &amp;ldquo;Blueprints&amp;rdquo;. Inside of it, right click to create a new asset. Under &amp;ldquo;Create Basic Asset&amp;rdquo;, select &amp;ldquo;Blueprint Class&amp;rdquo;. In the window that pops up, select the top option button, called &amp;ldquo;Actor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos152.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two UE5 screenshots put next to one another. First one is context menu for creating new asset, with the &amp;ldquo;Blueprint Class&amp;rdquo; blue icon circled. Second is the window that pops up on the screen after clicking on the context menu. Its a list with common type of blueprint classes. The top one, &amp;ldquo;Actor&amp;rdquo; is circle, thats the one we want to create.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Find the static mesh you created in the first part of this tutorial series. From the &amp;ldquo;Content Drawer&amp;rdquo; drag it into the Blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the newly added mesh. On the right hand side panel, first change the &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. Then click on the Material and find your vortex material instance, the one that has default white color tint on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With mobility set to static from the previous step, we can now click and hold the mesh on the left hand side of the screen and then drag it on top of &amp;ldquo;DefaultSceneRoot&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our material instance that we edit through the construction script, we can also see our &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; parameter. In fact any of the &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameters&amp;rdquo; or the &amp;ldquo;Vector Parameters&amp;rdquo; seen in here, we could edit, if we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From all of the descriptions and material vs construction script images you see above, you hopefully learned that we need to be careful and track exactly how we name our parameters inside of the material graph. We then use the names inside of our new blueprints, as exactly seen over in the material. If in your material you named your Base Tint to something different, then don&amp;#39;t copy that name from me, instead use the name you came up with back when you were making your material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-variable&#34;&gt;New Variable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all pins connected and with the &amp;ldquo;Parameter Name&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;Set Vector&amp;rdquo; node put correctly, now lets create a new Blueprint Variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the (+) sign seen below to add a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos173.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;We are back to the blueprint construction scrip board and this image showcases it. An arrow to the left points at a plus sign next to &amp;ldquo;VARIABLES&amp;rdquo;. Clicking it starts making a new variable that by default has red color that indicates a Boolean type.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly created variable, name &amp;ldquo;BaseColor&amp;rdquo;. You can do so by selecting the &amp;ldquo;NewVar&amp;rdquo; red boolean and then changing its name on the panel in the right hand side. From &amp;ldquo;Variable Type&amp;rdquo; over in that corner, search for &amp;ldquo;Linear Color&amp;rdquo; and set it to that. The red boolean indicator will turn into a dark blue Linear Color indicator. From the settings over there also turn on &amp;ldquo;Instance Editable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instance Editable turned on, in the settings there, is very important as that is what will let us change the color when we drag a blueprint instance in the open world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos174.jpg&#34;

From the context menu that shows and asks if you want to &amp;ldquo;Get&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Set&amp;rdquo; the Base Color, pick &amp;ldquo;Get. The node seen below will show up. Connect Base Color node pin into &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Set Vector Parameter Value on Material&amp;rdquo; node seen below. It will do a conversion for us &lt;em&gt;(seen in the picture after the next one)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot that shows the result of Base Color dragged onto the board - a dark blue Base Color pin shows up. The image then shows us dragging its pin out and connecting it into the &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Set Vector&amp;rdquo; large node. With that a little text appears, with a red and blue icon, that says &amp;ldquo;Convert Linear Color Structure to Vector&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything should look like above after the new conversion pin &lt;em&gt;(the one going from dark blue to dark orange and then connecting into &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Blueprint board screenshot that shows our nodes work so far. Our dark blue node called Base Color connects into a dark orange conversion node that has no name visually. That then connects into Parameter Value of the large node &amp;ldquo;Set Vector Parameter&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we made our variable, instead of going for Linear Color we could have gone for Vector 3. That Vector 3 would have technically been a color - one with no alpha of course - that then directly connects above without needing a conversion node. When exposed, the Vector 3 would have X, Y and Z value and would not give us interface with a color picker, which is not ideal. Us using a Linear Color structure instead and then converting it to Vector 3 allows us to have a nice color picker which makes it more artist / user friendly. We will see that picker in action in a few pictures down this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;ldquo;BaseColor&amp;rdquo; from here (&lt;em&gt;the left side panel)&lt;/em&gt; again. Click on the black box on the right side panel to change the default color. I put mine to blue. That color picked seen here would not have worked had we not done it the way the green &amp;ldquo;Tip&amp;rdquo; box above describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos177.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another screenshot that now shows the Base Color selected and its right hand side settings change. The black box there is clicked and then change to a bright blue color, using a color picker seen in the image.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done with the Blueprint set up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-a-level&#34;&gt;In A Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag our newly finished blueprint into the scene. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos178.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1908&#34;
	height=&#34;1014&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A screenshot that shows a viewport looking at a blank UE5 level that comes with the default skybox, volumetric clouds and a plane with checkerboard material. In one corner, closest to the camera we have dragged in our newly created blueprint. It looks like a blue vortex.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now duplicate the newly placed blue vortex blueprint. Move it to the side. From the right &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; menu of UE5 change the color &lt;em&gt;(this is the Base Color variable that we implemented)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos179.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1913&#34;
	height=&#34;1043&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image that has identical to before subject and angle. Now next to the blue vortex blueprint that is out in the world, there is a secondary one. This secondary one has its Base Color blueprint variable changed to a pink, red color. That is reflected in the world too, where the material instance used on that dynamically has changed to the same shade of red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;183&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;440px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate your blueprint as many times. Set as many different colors you want. All of the materials are dynamic and are saved inside the level itself. As such our Project Directory is tidy and not overflowed with lots of material instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos180.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;904&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another UE5 blank level screenshot. Angle is same as before but now most of the before empty space is occupied by many vortex basins. There are blue, red, purple, green, yellow, white, teal and many more colors.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;133&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;320px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;color-previews&#34;&gt;Color Previews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one final view of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos181.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1125&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot similar to the previous one but now the camera is slightly from afar and orthographic looking. A line of six colored vortex, all different is put out. On a second line below, five more sit.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this optional part of the VFX tutorial for creating a vortex basin, we looked at Blueprint set ups. We learned how to bundle our few different static meshes so they are more artist friendly and efficient to use. We then looked into using construction script in order to connect a linear color blueprint parameter into the material used on the vortex. That allowed us to efficiently change the color of each unique vortex blueprint instance, once put in the world, without having to make unique material instances in our project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading and going through this tutorial series. I had a lot of fun putting it together and I sincerely hope it comes to be useful and educational for anyone reading it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me around a month and lots of hours after work to write this all up. It was a lot of effort to create all of the images, annotate them on top step by step, and give them alt text. I think we totalled to around 180 images. As such if you would like to drop a tip over at my Ko-fi page, I would be very grateful. You can find it in the blue badge link below. Alternatively you could purchase the asset itself from my shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Blue, purple and green one. Text on top reads Click here to buy the UE5 assets for this VFX over at Ko-fi.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos128.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 08 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Four" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Refraction Material Shader in UE5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we created the Polar Coordinates / Circular Distortion material shader in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; of this tutorial series, we will now add a secondary layer of detail on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be in the shape of a refraction effect that will sit above the polar coordinates material of the vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just now tuning in and would like to accomplish the visuals seen in the previews below, make sure to go over the previous entries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part One - Creating Static Geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Two - Creating Textures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like in the previous tutorial part, I will be creating the parent material in Unreal Engine 5. If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3. You can use any previous ones though, as already mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, lets see the final preview of everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;rsquo;ve created the geometry, the textures and the moving, syphon-inwards material graph. Now we will create the refraction material to go on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;refraction-preview&#34;&gt;Refraction Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the main visual already created - the circular vortex shader - we can now add another slice of detail to go on top. That will be in the shape of a refraction material that is mostly transparent. It will sit on a secondary copy of the base vortex basin static mesh. This copied static mesh will be moved slightly up in space so it floats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at refraction is a bit hard in static screenshots. It&amp;rsquo;s an effect that is much more visible in movement. However, here is a screenshot where if you look closely in the upper right corner of the cylindrical basin of the green vortex, you can notice the refraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos128.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot where a close up of the different colored VFX vortex basins is seen. The one closest to the camera, the green one, is observed to have broken, cells like appearance. That is due to the refraction shader.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;289&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;695px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refraction picks up colors from the rest of the scene. As such the warm gray color cells we see, above the green vortex, are not artifacts or transparent parts of the polar material. Instead its a refraction material put on a high value, picking up and refracting the rest of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might look a bit odd, and perhaps ugly, from this close up, at this high value. I have put it to an intensity overly high just to showcase it. In our final result it will be much more subtle and work with the vortex in a much better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have Pan U Refraction and Pan V Refraction scalars above. The ones going into the Panner node. I ended up not using those. You can either skip that part and have your TexCoord - Multiply - go directly into UVs of Normal Refraction, or you could follow and recreate it. I added them at first because I thought it might be useful to animate the refraction slightly in one direction. I ended up not using it. Perhaps you might want to try it and personalize your visual with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-the-refraction-graph&#34;&gt;Creating the Refraction Graph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the part of your Unreal Project Directory where you have a folder where you keep your Parent materials. Right click and create a new one. Name it &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change &amp;ldquo;Blend Mode&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Translucent&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Shading Model&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Unlit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-refraction&#34;&gt;Tiling Refraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click and search for a &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(or hold down &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard and press anywhere to instantly add one)&lt;/em&gt;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Position it like below. Next search for &amp;ldquo;Texture Coordinates&amp;rdquo; and add one below the &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Hold down &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard and then left mouse click anywhere on the screen to add a &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Connect the A of it into &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; into TexCoord[0].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;panner-optional&#34;&gt;Panner &lt;em&gt;(Optional)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the yellow note box at the start of this article, this part for creating a moving panner is optional. You could skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; and add it in here. Add two &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameters&amp;rdquo; and name them &amp;ldquo;Pan U Refraction&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pan V Refraction&amp;rdquo;. After them add &amp;ldquo;AppendMany&amp;rdquo; node and Connect R and G of it as seen in the image below. &lt;em&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Pan U Refraction&amp;rdquo; goes in &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pan V Refraction&amp;rdquo; goes in &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &amp;ldquo;Panner&amp;rdquo; connect each pin like seen below. Search for &amp;ldquo;TextureSampleParameter2D&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Normal Refraction&amp;rdquo;. From the settings set it to Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We said that the above Panner with its Time and two scalar parameters are optional. The TextureSampleParameter2D that we renamed to Normal Refraction is not optional (its mandatory). We need that even if we skip adding Panner. If you skipped it, revisit the previous image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new scalar parameter. Name it &amp;ldquo;Refraction Amount&amp;rdquo;. Search and add a &amp;ldquo;Linear Interpolate&amp;rdquo; from under &amp;ldquo;Maths&amp;rdquo; category. Connect &amp;ldquo;Refraction Amount&amp;rdquo; into the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; of the Lerp. In its &amp;ldquo;Alpha&amp;rdquo; connect the &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; chanel of the normal map &lt;em&gt;(Normal Refraction)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect all of it &lt;em&gt;(the result of the Lerp)&lt;/em&gt; into the Refraction (IOR) in the final material input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frame-and-tidy-up&#34;&gt;Frame and Tidy Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select all of the nodes below. Press &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. Name the newly created frame &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; and give it a blue color (or whatever color you like). Repositions your nodes inside so its more tidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opacity&#34;&gt;Opacity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; and name it &amp;ldquo;Opacity&amp;rdquo;. Connect it into the &amp;ldquo;Opacity&amp;rdquo; of the end material input. If you wish, frame it with a comment in red color.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot identical to before but now above the blue &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; collection of nodes, there is a new, red frame that has a green scalar parameter inside called &amp;ldquo;Opacity&amp;rdquo;. It then connects to the Opacity of the final material input.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all done with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;material-instance&#34;&gt;Material Instance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to your &amp;ldquo;Content Browser&amp;rdquo; and find your parent material that we just created. The &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Right click on the asset and from the new context menu select one of the top options that reads &amp;ldquo;Create Material Instance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rename the resulting instance from &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction_Inst&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos138.jpg&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following settings &lt;em&gt;(yours might appear in a different order because we didn&amp;rsquo;t group them, but that is okay)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refraction Amount: 0.76886&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pan U Refraction: 0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pan V Refraction: 0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiling Refraction: 0.007108&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal Refraction (texture): crystal_surfaces_normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The final one, the texture, is this one which you should have imported in your project already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos139.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it, then you can revisit the second tutorial of this series where we create the texture in Substance Designer. Find it over here &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-the-material-on-a-mesh&#34;&gt;Applying The Material on a Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets go back in an open scene where we have placed the vortex mesh basin and the polar coordinates material on it, as seen in the previous tutorial step - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader in UE5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this (below). Im focusing on a version not tinted in blue, purple or green, but you can focus on whichever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos140.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;392px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate the mesh. Move the new copy a few millimeters up in Z direction (thats on the blue axis). It should float slightly above the old mesh seen below. It should all look a bit like the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos141.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the material of the floating mesh above to the &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; material instance we just made &lt;em&gt;(that is &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step I went into Blender and made myself a hollow cylinder that is near the diameter of the vortex static mesh and protrudes outwards - that makes it a frame. I put that around my VFX to give it a finalized appearance and have it sit more like a hole or a well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t cover the making of this cylinder because I trust you could make one yourself. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go out of UE5 and into Maya or Blender, you could perhaps make your cylinder straight into UE5 using the Basic Brush geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look straight from above, you will see that in the dead middle of the basin, there is UV distortion that breaks the visuals a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The VFX meshes seen from above. Looking right in the middle we can see that there is UV distortion that makes the effect look a bit broken there.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;135&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;325px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could revisit the mesh and try to fix this in Blender, but I have a quicker and easier way that could potential look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &amp;ldquo;Quickly Add To The Project&amp;rdquo; context menu, navigate to &amp;ldquo;Shapes&amp;rdquo; and then click on &amp;ldquo;Plane&amp;rdquo; to add one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos145.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;UE5 project screenshot where we click on a button that looks like a white cube with a plus sign. It opens a contextual menu where we navigate to &amp;ldquo;Shapes&amp;rdquo; and from under there we select &amp;ldquo;Plane&amp;rdquo; that sits under &amp;ldquo;Cone&amp;rdquo; and other types of primitives.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;331px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position the newly added plane to the middle. It should sit just above the polar coordinates static mesh (so it hides the issue we have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos146.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another screenshot that shows a white plane added. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively small and its been moved so it sits in the middle of the VFX vortex static mesh basin.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;135&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;324px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the plane selected, change its material to the Polar Coordinates one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos147.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1648&#34;
	height=&#34;1009&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The same plane as seen before, is now selected and its material is changed to use the Polar Coordinates colored one. This hides the imperfection that we were getting and the UV distortion.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;391px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish, scale your plane up to personalize your visual by having the polar material on it be a bit larger that way. I personally left mine at xyz scale of 1,1,1 as it was seen in the previous step. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you. Just make sure if you scale it up to not have it go outside of the hollow cylinder, breaking the illusion and clipping outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done! Congrats on following through with this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final step of the tutorial series we went over creating a refraction material graph shader. We then applied that on a mesh that sits a few millimeters above our previous static mesh basin, giving it a secondary level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this tutorial we wrap up all visuals work on this. In the next, optional part, we will look over Blueprints functionality in UE5 / UE4 and how we can create an Actor that lets us change the color tint per instance basis, when used in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made yourself a VFX basin and picked a color tint you like, you can skip this next part. If you, however, wish to learn more about good practices with Blueprint Actors and how to use Construction Scripts in order to create more powerful set dressing actors, stick around for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Improving the efficiency of our work through Blueprints and Constructions Scripts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos100-c.png" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 07 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Three" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Polar Coordinates / Circular Distortion in UE5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we cover how to make an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. There are two other parts in this tutorial series. In &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; we created the base static geometry needed for the VFX. Then in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; we created some textured noises in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this third part, we will use the textures created inside an Unreal 5 Material Graph. First we will created the &amp;ldquo;parent&amp;rdquo; material, then we will copy an instance of it and tweak the values of the different scalars and parameters and get the visual that we see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this third part, I will be created the parent material in Unreal Engine 5. If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3. You can use any previous ones though, as already mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, before we go into UE5 and start working, lets see a reminder of what the end result will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous two parts of the tutorial we made the geometry and the textures, now we will create the main part - the shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots-preview&#34;&gt;Screenshots Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen before, here are screenshot previews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos070.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Two vortex VFXs next to one another. One is tinted in black and blue. The other is tinted in purple and blue. Their surface has long stripes of emissive color but also a lot of distortion as if its seen through refraction. Unreal 5 screenshots.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said in the previous entries, we are making only the VFX, not the rest of the room or art, but you can read about the creation process of those over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos071.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another angle showcasing the vortex basin VFX. This time its 3 of them. A blue, purple and then a green one. They are seen in a placeholder scene with grid materials. The camera is from very, very far away and unrealistically small Field of View (or otherwise large Focal Length), reducing the perspective and showcasing the props as if from an orthographic view.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;polar-coordinates&#34;&gt;Polar Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into creating our UE5 material graph, I want to take a moment and talk about the shader itself. The technique we are after is UV distortion and tiling that with a panner makes a movement towards a central point. Like a vortex. This effect is accomplished through &amp;ldquo;polar coordinates&amp;rdquo;. It is all UV coordinates distortion. We feed in an ordinary tiling texture and we manipulate its UVs to get a circular, inwards motion (or outwards, we can change direction just through one parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very simple, short explanation of what exactly we are doing is the following. We take linear direction coordinates: on the U and V axis and we use maths to distort them into circular coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-other-games&#34;&gt;In Other Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above explained technique is incredibly powerful. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to create and its not very demanding resources wise (&lt;em&gt;it scales on the GPU, which is always a good thing for performance in games&lt;/em&gt;). As such its very commonly seen in games. That is both in old and new titles. Both in AAA and indie games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I wanted to show you a few examples that I came across randomly, without searching, while I was playing some games recently. That will help you see the elegance of the technique we are about to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diablo-iv&#34;&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Diablo 4 that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing quite a bit at the time of writing this, there are a few world bosses. The map gets a pin with a timer that gives you 30 minutes to get to a special zone where the boss entity will spawn. Lots of players gather there and if you are early you get to see a few different animations and effects that show the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;preparation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; of the spawning of the giant enemy you are about to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ashava the Pestilent is about to spawn, their presence in Saraan Caldera is announced by this large, toothed mesh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut showing Ashava the Pestilent spawn mesh in the zone Saraan Caldera in Diablo 4.&#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Shows a clip from Diablo 4 that shows a flesh, bones and tooths-like giant 3D mesh. In the middle there is a flat plane with a vortex VFX motion that moves outwards, as if some miasma, tar and poison moves.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look past the mesh and its movement, and focus on the middle, you will see a flat plane with a VFX material applied to it. That material is absolutely identical to the one we are making. Its a vortex like motion, panned outwards. The artist at Blizzard have made and applied normal and albedo textures to give it a dark, tar-like appearance. Looks amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baldurs-gate-3&#34;&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another title I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with &lt;em&gt;(many of you most likely are as well)&lt;/em&gt; is Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut showing from Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Shows a party of adventurers with a bright visual effect under them. They are in the dark interior of the Moonrise Towers zone.&#34;&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Another video embed above. Shows four adventurers inside the dark interiors of Moonrise Towers zone. Under their feet is an animated aura VFX. It looks like a bright, chroma and rainbow vortex.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look under the feet of my Tiefling Sorcerer in the video above, on the dark floor tiles of Moonrise Towers you will see a bright, white vortex with outwards movement. From time to time it gets a chromatic tint that gives it a subtle rainbow look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This again is exactly the polar coordinates UV distortion we are making. The difference between this one and ours &lt;em&gt;(and the one in Diablo 4)&lt;/em&gt; is that here, the devs at Larian Studios have also put a low opacity mask. That gives the effect a more transparent look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;material-graph-preview&#34;&gt;Material Graph Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets first see the entire material graph:&lt;/p&gt;

Lots of nodes are bundle together and framed into 3 color categories: blue for &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo;, white for &amp;ldquo;Texture Sample&amp;rdquo; node and final red group for &amp;ldquo;Color Control&amp;rdquo;. The final pin gets connected to the output seen in the right side.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;With the output (final node) selected, here are its material settings to the left side of the screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &amp;ldquo;Material Domain&amp;rdquo; we use &amp;ldquo;Surface. In the &amp;ldquo;Blend Mode&amp;rdquo; we go &amp;ldquo;Opaque&amp;rdquo;. For &amp;ldquo;Shading Model&amp;rdquo; we use &amp;ldquo;Unlit&amp;rdquo;. Two Sided is ticked off, Use Material Attributes is off as well. &amp;ldquo;Cast Ray Traced Shadows&amp;rdquo; is on and for Subsurface Profile there is nothing. The Advanced settings are left to their default states.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you only want to get the visual result and are not interested in any technical, mathematical or further detailed explanation behind some of the steps and nodes, you can replicate what you see from the zoomed up pictures above and skip most of the tutorial below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets start from the beginning though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-the-polar-coordinates&#34;&gt;Creating the Polar Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &amp;ldquo;Materials&amp;rdquo; folder in your project directory. Inside create a &amp;ldquo;Parents&amp;rdquo; folder. In there we will create our parent materials from which we will create our instanced materials later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click in there and make a new material. Name it &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Vortex&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Open it. Click the output node and lets tweak the settings, putting them to what we mentioned tiny bit ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos105.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click anywhere. In the search box that appears write &amp;ldquo;tex&amp;rdquo; and once &amp;ldquo;TextureCoordinates&amp;rdquo; appears, click on it to add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos106.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;421px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. Press once on the board, under the newly added TexCoord node. A new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; will appear. It will have its name set as &amp;ldquo;Param&amp;rdquo;. Edit it and name it &amp;ldquo;Polar Centre&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos107.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;component-mask&#34;&gt;Component Mask&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the search we explained, find and add &amp;ldquo;Subtract&amp;rdquo; node. Connect it like what is seen below. Then search &amp;ldquo;ComponentMask&amp;rdquo; and add two of them. We will order and tweak them in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos108.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;176&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;422px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;ldquo;ComponentMask&amp;rdquo; node. By default &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; channels are on. For node that is on the top row, leave only &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; on. For the node that is at the bottom, leave &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; on. Then search for a &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Add it like seen below (which is both A and B connected to the Subtract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos109.jpg&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arctangent2&#34;&gt;Arctangent2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Arctangent2&amp;rdquo; and add one. Connect the two masks into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arc tangent is an inverse tangent function. We do an inverse tangent function because we are switching from Cartesian coordinates and moving into Polar coordinates. We are doing Arctangent2 instead of Arctangent because we are dealing with a coordinates system split into four quadrants. Arctangent would limit us only into quadrant number one and four. By the end of this tutorial I&amp;#39;ve linked further reading on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you would like a bit more optimized result, you can replace your Arctangent2 for Arctangent2Fast. It is a node a bit less accurate, but still accurate enough for our visuals to remain the same.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pi&#34;&gt;Pi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a &amp;ldquo;Component Mask&amp;rdquo; again, this time change its settings so only &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; channel is on. After it add a &amp;ldquo;Divide&amp;rdquo; node and connect the Mask into A. Then search for &amp;ldquo;math pi&amp;rdquo; and select Pi to add on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos111.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another shot that shows adding a new component mask, right after Arctangent2. Then its followed by adding Divide right after Mask &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo;. The image then shows searching for &amp;ldquo;math pi&amp;rdquo; and adding a &amp;ldquo;Pi&amp;rdquo; node (seen in next image).&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a Scalar Parameter with a value of 2 and connect it into Multiplier (S) input of the Pi node. Connect the Pi output into the B input of Divide node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos112.jpg&#34;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you are recreating this in Unity in Shader Graph or in Amplify Shader Editor. Because you totally could, all nodes and functions exist over there, no matter it is another engine. If for some reason Pi is not defined in whatever package you have, you could just add a new scalar parameter and give it a value of == 6.2831 which would be correct enough approximation of 2 x Pi for the shader to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frac&#34;&gt;Frac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &amp;ldquo;Divide&amp;rdquo; node, add a &amp;ldquo;Frac&amp;rdquo; node. Now take a look at the lower row, right after the &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Create a Mask (R) and Mask (G) nodes. Connect both of them into an &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; node.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;SquareRoot&amp;rdquo;. Add it into the board (it will show up as &amp;ldquo;Sqrt&amp;rdquo;). Now put two &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; nodes at each row and connect into &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos114.jpg&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Tip for a tidy board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select all of the nodes and press &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard (C stands for Comment in this case). That will add a big frame over it all. For text put in &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo;. Change the color to blue or whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the right side of the previous work, right after the &amp;ldquo;Append&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search &amp;ldquo;Texture Sample&amp;rdquo;. Add one and connect &amp;ldquo;Append&amp;rdquo; into its &amp;ldquo;UVs&amp;rdquo; pin. With the &amp;ldquo;Texture Sample&amp;rdquo; selected, rename it to &amp;ldquo;AlbedoTexture&amp;rdquo;. In its settings change the following: MipValueMode: MipLevel (absolute, 0 is full resolution). Sampler Type: Linear Color. (these are pointed in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;color-control&#34;&gt;Color Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets create the final part of the shader. It will be a bunch of new nodes that we will then frame into a red comment box, as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by adding a &amp;ldquo;Vector Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to a new Multiply. Then add a new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Tint Power&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to the Multiply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Brightness&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; of a new Multiply node. In the A connect the AlbedoTexture node from the previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a final &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;. In the A input of it, add the previous &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;. In the B, add the &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; that comes right after the &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; color node (vector parameter). The result of this final &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;, connect into the &amp;ldquo;Emissive Color&amp;rdquo; of the final Material Input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(When you are done with all of the above you can select it all and add yourself a red comment frame, like seen below. Name it &amp;ldquo;Color Control&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to your Project Directory. Find where this material parent that we just made is. Right click on it and select &amp;ldquo;Create Material Instance&amp;rdquo;. Call it &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Open it. All of the Scalar Parameters and Vector Parameters (color) have default values but we now want to connect our texture in there and also change the values so we get the visual we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parameters&#34;&gt;Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After opening the newly created material instance, use the parameter values as seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preview-in-action&#34;&gt;Preview in Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag into a scene the imported vortex geometry you created in part one of the tutorial. Then change its scale to 1.5 1.5 1.3 &lt;em&gt;(this is optional, I just scaled mine a bit so its not too small when compared to a 2m tall human mannequin)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats! This is it. You should be able to see the movement and animation in the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dragged your material shader onto the geometry and your object suddenly turned pitch black, then lets fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This most commonly happens on older versions of UE.5. Its due to the material graph parent shader not being suitable for &amp;ldquo;Nanite Geometry&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the imported static geometry vortex basin from the project directory (content browser). Now re-import it but this time around from the Import settings tick &amp;ldquo;Nanite&amp;rdquo; off. Now retry dragging it into the scene and applying the material and it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the VFX result from a camera angle from above, you will see UV distortion imperfection. We resolve that in the next part of the tutorial. Even if you don&amp;#39;t want to create a refraction shader, and would like to skip that, make sure to still visit the next tutorial and find the solution to this UV distortion issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;where we can see the solution to fixing the UV distortion in the middle.&lt;/a&gt; Scroll down to the &amp;ldquo;Troubleshooting&amp;rdquo; chapter in there to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;color&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep it to white here because in the final part of the tutorial series, we will create a Blueprint in which we control the color tint. That part is optional. As such if you prefer to skip it, and instead want the colors right away, as seen in the tutorial previews (blue, purple, green), then do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create 3 copies of the above material instance. That is the one we just made and called &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Those copies rename &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Blue”, &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Purple” and &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Green”. Go in each and change the &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; HEX linear value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue: 1A5CF700&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple: 941AF700&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green: 1AF78100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we created the main driving force of the VFX: the polar coordinates shader. We then created material instances of it and went over what settings to use in order to get the visual we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next part of the series, we will quickly create a &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; material shader. We will use that as a floating layer of detail, above the vortex we have now. This step will be incredibly short and easy to make in comparison to the length and difficulty of the previous 3 parts of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos072.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial covers how to create an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. In &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; we already went over how to create the geometry needed for the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &amp;ldquo;Part Two&amp;rdquo; blog entry, we will go over how to create some quick textured noises in Substance Designer. Those textures are one of the driving forces in the VFX effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I will be using Substance 3D Designer 2021. The nodes I use are widely available in older versions of the software too, so you should be able to follow along without an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into the Substance work, lets take a look at a reminder of what we are creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the previous tutorial part, the textures and shaders we create will allows us to derive many colored versions of the VFX:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots-preview&#34;&gt;Screenshots Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen before, here are screenshot previews:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos070.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Two vortex VFXs next to one another. One is tinted in black and blue. The other is tinted in purple and blue. Their surface has long stripes of emissive color but also a lot of distortion as if its seen through refraction. Unreal 5 screenshots.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;189&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;454px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are making only the VFX, not the rest of the room or art, but you can read about the creation process of those over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos071.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another angle showcasing the vortex basin VFX. This time its 3 of them. A blue, purple and then a green one. They are seen in a placeholder scene with grid materials. The camera is from very, very far away and unrealistically small Field of View (or otherwise large Focal Length), reducing the perspective and showcasing the props as if from an orthographic view.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;textures-preview&#34;&gt;Textures Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what we will create in this tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos073.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;4266&#34;
	height=&#34;4470&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Three images, composed next to one another in one image. First one is a black and white, liquid-spill noise. It has lots of plasma-like outlines. Second one four copies of it, tinted in blue, purple, green and yellow. Third is a normal map in the typical for normal map color ranges. The noise on it looks like a triangulated close up of a crystal surface. Their names (the text) is transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;95&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;229px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need two textures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 - Main &amp;ldquo;Liquid Noise&amp;rdquo; Texture;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 - Normal &amp;ldquo;Crystal Matrix&amp;rdquo; Texture;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are all very short and quick Substance Designer graphs. Some of the noises, like the crystal normals we then will reuse twice in the refraction shader for the VFX. My process when making VFX or any general 3D scenes most of the times includes creating &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; type of noises - both b&amp;amp;w and normal map ones - and then reusing them across assets. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact I created the textures you see above for the normal tiling details and texture work on the center piece, giant crystal cluster prop in the scene over here: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; I liked how they turned out and believed I could reuse them in a VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-one---albedo-main-mask&#34;&gt;Step One - Albedo (Main Mask)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets first create the liquid-spill, black and purple &amp;ldquo;albedo&amp;rdquo; texture. We will make a desaturated, black and white one first but then with a few quick edits in the UE5 shader for the VFX we will derive other colored variants in our Material Graph and Blueprint set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos074.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;999&#34;
	height=&#34;968&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from Substance Designer. Upper parts shows the pinboard with the nodes. Seven nodes end up in an output, creating the texture seen in the lower part of the screenshot. There one can observe a preview of a 4k black and white liquid spill texture.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;103&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;247px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the visual here is powerful but quite simple, accomplished just by the use of 7 nodes. Lets go over them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moisture-noise&#34;&gt;Moisture Noise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a blank 4k graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for a &amp;ldquo;Moisture Noise&amp;rdquo; and drag a copy into the graph. Select the node (the Moisture Noise one) and edit its Instance Parameters to the following: Scale: 1, Disorder: 0.21, Pattern Size X: 2 Pattern Size Y: 0.68, Pattern Angle: Turns: 0.505 and Degrees 181.8, Pattern Angle Random: 0.01, Global Opacity 1.79.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos075.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Graph and texture preview screenshot from Designer. Shows step one of searching for &amp;ldquo;Moisture Noise&amp;rdquo; then adding it to the graph, then editing its settings to be as what is transcribed in the paragraph above. The result is a moisture noise that looks prolonged on the X axis - very long and slim appearance.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plasma--slope-blur&#34;&gt;Plasma + Slope Blur&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Moisture Noise node, add a Plasma node. Edit its instance parameters to the following: Scale: 0 and Disorder: 0.53.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos076.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another graph texture. Shows searching for &amp;ldquo;Plasm&amp;rdquo; node and adding it under the &amp;ldquo;Moisture&amp;rdquo; node. It&amp;rsquo;s settings are then tweaked (seen in the right lower corner). The numbers in the settings match what is transcribed above.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets add a &amp;ldquo;Slope Blur Grayscale&amp;rdquo; node. Search for that and plop it to the right of the existing two nodes. Make sure you drag in a &amp;ldquo;Grayscale&amp;rdquo; one and not a &amp;ldquo;Color&amp;rdquo; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We are currently defining our main shapes, noises and motives. We best do that in black and white as its easier to manipulate the nodes in that mode. Later on, once we like the shapes and patterns we have, we will introduce color. This is the reason we are currently using Grayscale nodes as opposed to Color ones. In general, in most art mediums, its easier to approach things step by step, starting black and white and then later moving to color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos077.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Graph screenshot showing the &amp;ldquo;Moisture Noise&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Plasma&amp;rdquo; connected together into a &amp;ldquo;Slope Blur Grayscale&amp;rdquo;. The result is liquidated, Saturn surface-like patterns. The settings for the Slope Blur are described above. &#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, lets simplify all we have and lose some of the fine details and gradient-like blurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Quantize&amp;rdquo;. Select a grayscale one. Add it to the right of the Slope Blur. For its instance parameters use &amp;ldquo;Quantize: 5&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos078.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another graph screenshot. Shows first searching &amp;ldquo;quan&amp;rdquo; and selecting and dragging a &amp;ldquo;Quantize Grayscale&amp;rdquo; node. Then connecting it and changing its settings to a power of 5. The visual result is the Saturn-like, liquid noise like before, but now incredibly simplified. It looks almost like pixel art or like through a dithering pattern. &#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Quantize in, everything is more simple. But we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leave it looking pixelated and harsh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a &amp;ldquo;Blur HQ&amp;rdquo; node and connect it to the Quantize node. Click to edit its settings and use the following. Intensity: 0.57 and Quality: 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos079.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Substance Designer screenshot showcasing searching up and adding a &amp;ldquo;Blur HQ Grayscale Node&amp;rdquo;. Then in its settings tweaking it to have intensity of 0.57 and quality of 1. The visual is like he previous step - simplified - but now not ragged and dithered.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-color-gradient&#34;&gt;Adding Color Gradient&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the main motives in. Now lets give them a grayscale color gradient. Search for &amp;ldquo;Gradient Map&amp;rdquo; and drag a copy of that node. Connect it to our previous node. In its settings put Color Mode: Grayscale. Then click the button called &amp;ldquo;Gradient Editor&amp;rdquo; under the &amp;ldquo;Color Mode&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Gradient Addressing&amp;rdquo; options in order to open the Gradient Ramp expanded window (where you select colors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos080.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Graph screenshot showing the addition of a &amp;ldquo;Gradient Map&amp;rdquo; node. Its gradient ramp settings are then a selection of dark and light shades. The end result is an even more simplified version of the previous result.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want to hand place color pins, similar to what you see here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos081.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1121&#34;
	height=&#34;603&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up screenshot of the settings of the Gradient Editor and its &amp;ldquo;Ramp&amp;rdquo;. A bright gray region of the gradient ramp is selected and its color value is a hex #a3a3a3. The result is seen to the right - the black and white oil spill texture.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;185&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;446px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to entirely match it. In fact, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be precise at all. If you like my shade grayscale colors and the result, then copy the gray color seen above (its hex code is #a3a3a3). Then start hand placing similar pins left and right. You can expand the Gradient Editor window by dragging its right corner. That way you can see better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is min expanded, hopefully you can match yours to it better that way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos081_02.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1638&#34;
	height=&#34;889&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image identical to the previous one but now the Designer &amp;ldquo;Gradient Editor&amp;rdquo; window is much longer, expanded horizontally. That way all of the black and white pins are easier to see.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;184&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;442px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I encourage you to experiment and give your own touch and vision to this step. Use my placement of gray pins if you want identical effect. If not, try your own but just try to have a good amount of darkness spots, as in above, as that is what keeps the VFX easier to read, stylish and mysterious. Also keep it black and white because we will tint it in color in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next lets add &amp;ldquo;Levels&amp;rdquo; node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search &amp;ldquo;Levels&amp;rdquo; and put one right after the Gradient Map node. In its settings (its Specific Parameters), there is a Levels Histogram. It looks like a large mostly white (gray) square. On each corner it has a thumb. Move the upper, right corner, white thumb inwards. Move it to about the position seen in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos082.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Substance Designer screenshot showing searching up &amp;ldquo;Levels&amp;rdquo; node and then dragging its green icon to the Graph. To the right, in its settings, there is a gray rectangle. The image shows clicking the upper right thumb in that rectangle and moving it inwards.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets quickly blur HQ once again though. That will make sure we don&amp;rsquo;t have any overly sharp areas. In the world of textures, sharpness is good, but when its too much it gives artificial, low-quality look to things. As such we want to avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Blur HQ Color&amp;rdquo;. Add it and for its settings use: Intensity: 0.1 and Quality: 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos083.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another graph screenshot. Showcases searching and adding &amp;ldquo;Blur HQ Grayscale&amp;rdquo;. Its then connected to the previous node and has intensity of 0.1 and quality of 1. The end result is such a subtle blur, that its hard to see the difference.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;output-node&#34;&gt;Output Node&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are done, add an &amp;ldquo;Output&amp;rdquo; node. That together with proper compression settings will let you export your texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos084.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1646&#34;
	height=&#34;1004&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Graph shot that shows adding an &amp;ldquo;Ouput Node&amp;rdquo;. Its settings are described in the sentence below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;393px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the settings of the Output node, use these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifier: whatever name you want. Mine happens to be &amp;ldquo;TEX_Liquid_Albedo&amp;rdquo; but yours might be &amp;ldquo;output&amp;rdquo; which is fine. You might want to name it similar to mine as it will be easier to identify later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description: empty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Label: Base Color&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User Data: empty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group: Material&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Format: Default Format. Mipmaps: Full pyramid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above ones are mostly used for visualization in Substance Designer. As such they are not overly important but you might want to match them to mine nonetheless. Then come the important ones which will dictate how the bitmap looks and behaves after export. Those are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage: Components: RGB with usage &amp;ldquo;mask&amp;rdquo; and Color Space put to Linear.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the settings put to what is needed, now right click your graph name under the *.sbs work file you have open. This is in the upper left corner of the screen, where it says EXPLORER. From the context menu that shows up with right click, select &amp;ldquo;Export outputs as bitmaps&amp;rdquo;. In the screen that pops up, make sure your &amp;ldquo;TEX_Liquid_Albedo&amp;rdquo; is selected, pick an export destination and hit &amp;ldquo;Export outputs&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-two---normal-crystal-matrix-texture&#34;&gt;Step Two - Normal &amp;ldquo;Crystal Matrix&amp;rdquo; Texture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, lets create the normal map that we will use in the refraction shader that gives a secondary level of detail and visual interest to our VFX basin.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Substance Designer screenshot that looks at a graph. There are 10 nodes connected between one another and finishing up in an 11th, Output node. Below is a normal map in the typical tangent space colors. It features patterns and motives like lots of triangulated crystals.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a relatively quick node graph as well. If the previous one we did was 7 nodes, then this one is 10 nodes &lt;em&gt;(without taking the output in this total sum)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;crystal-1--crystal-2&#34;&gt;Crystal 1 &amp;amp; Crystal 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by searching for &amp;ldquo;Crystal&amp;rdquo;. Two nodes will show up. We want both. Drag the &amp;ldquo;Crystal 1&amp;rdquo; node on the top in the graph. Under it, place a &amp;ldquo;Crystal 2&amp;rdquo; node. Then take a note of the settings to the right for each, displayed in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Settings for Crystal 1 - black one - Scale: 55, Disorder: 0.19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Settings for Crystal 2 - white one - Scale: 1, Disorder: 0)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the right of Crystal 2 (bright one)  lets add a &amp;ldquo;Histogram Scan&amp;rdquo;. Search and drag a copy of that. Connect it as seen below. Then double click it and for settings put the following: Position: 0.31 and Contrast: 0. Invert Position: False.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to turn this black and white texture into a normal texture now. Search for &amp;ldquo;Normal&amp;rdquo;. Pick the one seen below as an icon &lt;em&gt;(if you are on an older version of Substance Designer, your icon might be different. Try to find a node that takes any input and turns it into Normal)&lt;/em&gt;. In the settings of &amp;ldquo;Normal&amp;rdquo; node manually click the number of the &amp;ldquo;Intensity&amp;rdquo;. That will let you type 8 as a value. If you just drag the slider, you might reach an upper limit of 3. We can go over it by clicking on the number 3 itself and putting whatever we want through our keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In your Substance Designer little window that gives you a preview of your texture, your normal map end result might look overly noisy and pixelated. A bit glitchy, like what I have in the image above. After you export it, using the next step, you can open up your final image and you will see that it does not look that overly noisy and glitchy. It will still have stepping lines, lots of them, but they will appear much better.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets export to a bitmap &lt;em&gt;(an image)&lt;/em&gt;. Right click the name of your graph. You can find that under the name of your current *.sbs file, in upper left corner of Designer. Hit &amp;ldquo;Export outputs as bitmaps&amp;rdquo;. From the window that appears, make sure your newly created normal texture output is selected. Pick a location to export it to and hit export.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this tutorial I exported a few of my textures as a *.PNG format. However, most of the time in my personal projects I save out as a *.TGA instead (Truevision Targa). Over at work at Rebellion, I save and use exclusively only *.TGA as well. That is pretty much the common standard used in the games industry.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In general, *.TGA is a very high quality file format. This is incredibly beneficial for texture types like normal maps, where lossy compression, for example *.JPG is detrimental. *.PNG is lossless, yet as mentioned above, in most game studios, *.TGA is the standard.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done and have created two textures and exported them. One is a black and white mask that we use like an &amp;ldquo;albedo&amp;rdquo; but tint in a color later in Unreal 5. The second one is a normal map &amp;ldquo;matrix&amp;rdquo; noise that we will use in a refraction shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Import your textures to your Unreal project. Your normal map will get picked up automatic by the engine as being a normal map, and will get its settings changed to the correct ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos099.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;367px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, your black and white, &amp;ldquo;liquid&amp;rdquo; mask, after import, you want to double click and open in Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/amarantos098.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 texture inspect window, but this time around looking at the black and white liquid spill. If you scroll down in the settings to the right, you will find an sRGB tick box. Turn that off. The image here has an arrow pointing it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;153&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;368px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the textures created and all imported, in the next entry of this tutorial we will create the &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo; main Material Graph that will support our VFX. We will use the textures in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we will create a second, smaller material shader. That one will be a refraction one and will be an additional layer of detail, to sit above our liquid spill vortex.&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/amarantos070-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 05 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part One" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog entry will be a bit different from the previous ones in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of an overview and writing about my creative process, this one is a step-by-step guide. It is a written tutorial about how to create an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. It also will go over how to create geometry needed by the VFX idea and how to create some quick textured noises in Substance Designer. The textures are one of the driving forces in the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you prefer Maya or 3Ds Max over Blender, then you could replicate the steps I take in your modelling package of choice and create the mesh we will need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use Unreal Engine 5. However, we will not use any new or locked to UE5 features. If you are working in Unreal Engine 4, you could easily follow and replicate anything you see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, lets dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into the steps of creating the VFX, lets take a look at a quick preview. It will show us what we are about to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material shader we will create will allow us to reuse every piece we&amp;rsquo;ve made and derive different colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots-preview&#34;&gt;Screenshots Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some screenshot previews, showing the VFX in static images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/amarantos070.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two vortex VFXs next to one another. One is tinted in black and blue. The other is tinted in purple and blue. Their surface has long stripes of emissive color but also a lot of distortion as if its seen through refraction. Unreal 5 screenshots.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover how to create only the vortex itself. It will not look at how to make the sculpture, stone basin that the VFX sits in. It will also not look at the making of any other art elements seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious how the environment room was created and then how the crystals shaped to existence, you can do so by reading my previous entries in the blog series. You can do so over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/amarantos071.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another angle showcasing the vortex basin VFX. This time its 3 of them. A blue, purple and then a green one. They are seen in a placeholder scene with grid materials. The camera is from very, very far away and unrealistically small Field of View (or otherwise large Focal Length), reducing the perspective and showcasing the props as if from an orthographic view.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like the VFX and you are not here for learning, but instead would wish to purchase the UE5 assets, follow the link by clicking the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/s/1e9696c777&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/vfxvortexkofi2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Image link button showing 3 vfx vortex basins. Blue, purple and green one. Text on top reads Click here to buy the UE5 assets for this VFX over at Ko-fi.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pieces-necessary&#34;&gt;Pieces Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The necessary pieces we will need and see how to create in this tutorial are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Static mesh - this is a torus shaped into a basin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo; material shader - this is the black and blue material that pans inwards, creating a &amp;ldquo;vortex&amp;rdquo; effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Refraction material shader - material using a tiled normal map that refracts light and sits on top of the main vortex as a secondary slice of detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x Texture noises. One for masking things (linear, black and white). Another for the black and blue liquid visual (this acts bit like an albedo). Then a final normal map that has crystal-like distortions and when tiled the correct amount gives the refraction shader its appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with first creating the Static Meshes needed for the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;base-shape&#34;&gt;Base Shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into any detailed steps about how to create the geometry, lets first see the final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxMesh.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3840&#34;
	height=&#34;2160&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A vortex basin static mesh, seen from a few different angles. First 2 images are top-down view. Then are two views from profile. One shaded, one wireframe. There are metrics on top too, which are transcribed in the paragraph below this image.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following guide we will recreate the geo seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vortex basin above has two key metrics: its wide 2 meters and its tall around 0.75 meters. As it goes downwards in space, its diameter of 2 meters shrinks to 1.5 meter then to 1.2 m then to a final 0.15 meters. The numbers above in the image have floating points but you can stick to the round numbers mentioned just now. The mesh is UV mapped without any seams (planar top-view mapping). Any slight distortion in the islands due to that will not be a problem and will instead help our VFX final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(You can inspect the UVs in step 5.13, seen right by the end of this page.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are an intermediate to advanced 3D modeller, don&amp;#39;t feel obliged to follow the next steps. By looking at the wireframe mesh above, you could recreate a similar results of your own, however you wish. For the VFX basin to look like the final results you don&amp;#39;t need to constrain yourself to a carbon copy geometry. You could put your own touch of tweaks and personalizations on your geometry and still get an awesome result. If that is the case, skip through all of the Blender steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, if you wish to skip the geometry guide, and have created something of your own, head to this link &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for the next part in this VFX tutorial series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-one&#34;&gt;Step One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by opening a new Blender scene and pressing SHIFT + A to create a new primitive shape. From the drop-down menu, pick a Cylinder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut001.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1531&#34;
	height=&#34;964&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows blank scene. On top &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; menu is open with the &amp;ldquo;Mesh - Cylinder&amp;rdquo; option selected. Text in image reads: &amp;ldquo;1. Press SHIFT &amp;#43; A to open &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. 2. Navigate under &amp;ldquo;Mesh&amp;rdquo; and click &amp;ldquo;Cylinder&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;381px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding a cylinder, in the lower, left corner of the screen we will get options to pick the features of the cylinder primitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-two&#34;&gt;Step Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1531&#34;
	height=&#34;1022&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows the scene with an added cylinder. Text in image reads: &amp;ldquo;3. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see these options, then your menu is collapsed. Click on the text &amp;ldquo;Add Cylinder&amp;rdquo; for it to expand. 4. As options use the ones seen here: vertices 32, radius 1 meter, depth 1 meter.&amp;rdquo;&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a large context menu for &amp;ldquo;Add Cylinder&amp;rdquo; like above doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately show for you, then make sure to look for a small bar menu going by the same name, hidden in that same lower left corner. Clicking on it will expand you the settings seen in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the settings we can ignore. The important ones are &amp;ldquo;Vertices: 32&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Radius: 1 m&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Depth 1 m&amp;rdquo; is not particularly important because in the next step we will actually remove any edge loops that make up the outer ring faces of the cylinder. As such its depth will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-three&#34;&gt;Step Three&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, press anywhere on the cylinder with the left mouse button. Then hit TAB on your keyboard to go into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; (or perhaps you have yours set to ALT+E as a shortcut.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;1025&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows the cylinder clicked on to be selected. Then CTRL &amp;#43; TAB is pressed on the keyboard, bringing up a radial menu with options like &amp;ldquo;Object Mode, Edit Mode, Certex Paint, Sculpt Mode&amp;rdquo; and more. The picture shows the mouse selecting &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text on the picture reads: &amp;ldquo;5. Press Ctrl &amp;#43; TAB on keyboard to switch selection modes. Pick Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;356px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to switch from &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo; and go into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. If neither TAB or ALT+E work for you, then try with the contextual radial menu seen and described in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-four&#34;&gt;Step Four&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are in &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;, select all faces, everywhere, while keeping only the very top circle face deselected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut004.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1532&#34;
	height=&#34;979&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Here all of the rim edge faces of the cylinder, that compose its walls are selected. The circle at the bottom, not visible in the picture, is also selected. Through pressing &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to open &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu, all faces selected are deleting, leaving only the top circle face. Text transcription in the paragraph below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;156&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;375px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the image above describes, press &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to select all faces. Then hold down Shift on keyboard and left mouse button click on the circle at the top to deselect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next press &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. It will open the &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. From that dropdown menu select &amp;ldquo;Faces&amp;rdquo; to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to select the faces whilst only leaving the top circle deselected. Do whichever way you like and don&amp;#39;t feel obliged to follow the description above as to how to accomplish it. If you wish, select each face one by one with the mouse whilst holding shift. Or instead select by big face loops, by holding ALT and clicking on the outer edge of a face, the edge facing the direction you want to mass select a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have deleted all of the outer wall faces and the bottom face, we are left only with the top circle face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select it. Then press &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Inset Faces&amp;rdquo;. Click anywhere on the screen to have the lower left corner contextual menu for &amp;ldquo;Inset&amp;rdquo; appear (seen and described in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. That will start a &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo; command. If you follow up immediately by pressing &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; you will lock the movement onto that axis. Move the mouse slightly down. Then press anywhere on the screen in order to get the &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo; contextual menu show up. In that put in -0.07 m as a setting for Z.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I keep repeating the hotkeys for common actions like Move, Extrude, Scale and how they work with keyboard and mouse clicks and movements. I do that so this tutorial is friendly to any Blender users, especially those who might be beginners. However if you are an advanced user, feel free to skim through most of the texts here and extract only the important info of by how much and in what axis to extrude, move, scale, rotate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-eight&#34;&gt;Step Eight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate your camera slightly below the mesh so you can see better. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve selected the orange edge loop seen below. Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; then drag the mouse and click. When the context menu shows up, put 0.448 points in each axis uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut018.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The mesh is now seen slightly from below. New loop of faces is created by extruding then scaling down by 0.448 on x,y and z. Yellow text is transcribed in paragraph above.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;356px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets move that selecting upwards in space. The face loop we just created in the last step, we now want to move up by A LOT. Press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move mouse up. After clicking anywhere, menu shows up. Put 0.471 m in the field for Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut019.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;355px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets rotate our camera on the upside again. In the picture below we don&amp;rsquo;t do any new actions. Instead we look at how your mesh should look so far, when looked from the above angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut020.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mention this in a step later on, but: if your mesh so far looks roughly similar, but is not identical, and has some differences, don&amp;#39;t worry about it. This VFX relies on creating a --vortex basin-- but the rules for making that are not set in stone. You can have slight differences, or some of your loops might be slightly misplaced up or down, compared to mine in the pics above. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that your VFX won&amp;#39;t turn out just fine. It will look good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move cursor down. We are now moving the newly extruded loop down. In the Z put -0.6 m. Seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut021.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The mesh seen from above. The loop is moved down. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move cursor down. Move the new loop down, until it looks like above. You can get it to that by putting minus 0.6 m in the Z in the context menu.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets rotate the camera to look from below once again. Then press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale. Scale down uniformly on all axis by 0.356 points. This will give you the result like in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut022.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The mesh is seen from below now. The previously extruded and moved down loop is now scaled down by lots. That gives it an inverted cone appearance. The yellow text is transcribed in the sentence above.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; to extrude, then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; immediately to scale down. On every axis, scale down by 0.702 points. That gets us the little ring seen in the image below, that is sitting slightly flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets move the loop from last step down in space. Press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo;. Then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock on that axis. In the Move settings in context menu, put in minus 0.095 m for Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, rotate your camera to look at the mesh from above (so you can see it in a similar way to the image below). In this image we don&amp;rsquo;t do any actions. We just want to start looking at the mesh from this angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move your camera so you see the mesh a bit more from the side. Select the orange loop seen below. Lets twist that one too. When it&amp;rsquo;s selected, press &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Rotate&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock onto that rot axis. For an angle put 26.3 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;When selected, press &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Rotate&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock onto that rotation axis. For an angle put 17.7 degrees.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Select the top loop, seen in orange in the image below. Twist this one too. For an angle put minus 46 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the mesh from below / slight profile view again. Select the loop in orange below. This this one too. Reminder: to twist use &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to rotate, &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock onto that axis. Then press on the screen. In the context menu put an angle of 24.9 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate to look at the mesh from above. In this picture we don&amp;rsquo;t do any actions. Your mesh should look similar to above. If there are slight, very small differences, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The VFX will still look awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out of &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; and back to &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo; (reminder - for me, I do that by pressing TAB on the keyboard. You might have a different keybinding though.) Select your mesh - either by clicking on it or using the Collection Manager. Look at the right hand menus. Click on the &amp;ldquo;Modifiers&amp;rdquo; tab (its icon is in blue color and looks like a wrench). To the right of it then click &amp;ldquo;Add Modifier&amp;rdquo;. From the menu that shows up in picture after the next one, select &amp;ldquo;Subdivision Surface&amp;rdquo; as a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Modifier, as mentioned before, select &amp;ldquo;Subdivision Surface&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut033.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your geometry is subdivided and smooth now, but your normals are faceted. Lets smooth them out. Right click with mouse button anywhere on top of the mesh. From the &amp;ldquo;Object Context Menu&amp;rdquo; that shows up click to select &amp;ldquo;Shade Smooth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-ten&#34;&gt;Step Ten&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. You will see wireframe overlaid on top of the subdivided geometry. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, then make sure your settings here are identical as seen in the image below (step 39 is skipped due to numerical error, there are no images missing through).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the edge loop seen in orange below.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that selection made, press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale and then move the mouse inwards on the screen. Press anywhere. On the context menu that shows up, put uniform scale of 0.866 points in every axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut038.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;358px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets go back to &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo;. Select the mesh and in the right menu click on the blue arrow (seen in the screenshot below marked as number 1) then press on &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; (marked as number 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut039.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Imagine going through the steps of clicking the arrow on the Subdivision modifier and then clicking &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; that shows up as a command in the context menu. That bakes in the modifier.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we&amp;rsquo;ve applied the modifier, lets go back to &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. The mesh should look like below (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then most likely you&amp;rsquo;ve not applied the modifier yet. As such revisit the previous step.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut040.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1023&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mesh is seen with a now dense wireframe. This wireframe is visible in &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; because we&amp;rsquo;ve applied the modifier and are looking at the final geometry as result from it. Yellow text is transcribed above, as usual.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start selecting every second loop (hold ALT on the keyboard and then left mouse click on one edge and it will select the entire length of it). You can start selecting every second loop from wherever you like on the mesh. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to start from the spot I have started from in the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut041.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-eleven&#34;&gt;Step Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have selected every second loop, your selection should look like in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut042.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. This brings the &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. From that menu select &amp;ldquo;Dissolve Edges&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut043.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;With the selection of edges made, this image shows pressing &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard which brings a dropdown menu. In that menu there are &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; commands like &amp;ldquo;Vertices, Edges, Faces&amp;rdquo; etc. Select &amp;ldquo;Dissolve Edges&amp;rdquo; which is in the middle of the menu.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of deleting the edges should give you a mesh that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut044.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate the camera slightly. Then select the very top edge in the inner basin (it&amp;rsquo;s marked in orange in the image below). That edge looks too sharp, so we will bevel it (this will hold our UVs better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut045.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While holding the selection from the previous step, press &amp;ldquo;CTRL+E&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to start a Bevel. Drag the mouse slightly and click away for the context menu to show up. In the menu, use the settings seen below: &amp;ldquo;Segments: 1&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Width: 0.0169m&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look from above and zoom into the mesh. Select the very inner, final loop, where the mesh ends. Seen in orange below.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; to extrude then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale inwards. Scale down on all axis by any amount. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to close the loop yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. This will bring up the &amp;ldquo;merge&amp;rdquo; menu. From it select the top pick called &amp;ldquo;At Center&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the above, our geometry is done. Now lets double check our normal directions of our faces. Then lets UV map. Those are the two final steps before we call all of this done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-twelve---faces-direction&#34;&gt;Step Twelve - Faces Direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go out of &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; and back into &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut051.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1857&#34;
	height=&#34;1019&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;We observe the mesh from further away now, having moved the camera bit back. There is no wireframe on top because we&amp;rsquo;ve went out of Edit Mode.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;437px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, we want to double check if our normals are pointing in the right direction. In Blender, unlike Maya and 3Ds Max, when the faces point in the wrong direction, we still see shaded result. In the other two modelling softwares instead we would be seeing invisible mesh, and when rotating the camera we would understand thats the issue. Here instead we want to enable &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; viewport setting so we can observe any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the arrow (number 1 marked in the image below.) Then tick ON the &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; box in the menu that pops up. This is marked as (number 2) in the image below. Your mesh should then turn into a blue color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut052.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1914&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender UI seen where we press on the little blue arrow, marked with NUMBER 1 in yellow on the image. Dropdown menu is then show and we press NUMBER 2 arrow, which points to &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo;. The mesh gets shaded in blue color (or perhaps red, if you have an issue, but we cover that in the next image).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;408px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your mesh is red, that means your normals are facing the other way (inverted normals). This means that when seen from this upper side, the mesh will be invisible once in Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The mesh seen from the previous angle but now instead of tinted in an overpowering blue, its tinted in red color. As mentioned above, this indicates our normals are inverted.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;358px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix our faces direction (normal directions), first press CTRL+A to open the &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; submenu (make sure the mesh is first selected). From that menu select &amp;ldquo;All Transform&amp;rdquo;. In cases where the mesh had some crazy transformations not applied yet, the above step fixes the normals and makes it all blue. In this case chances are it wont fix it for you, but its a good thing to remember and always do anyway (to Apply - All Transformations).&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Image showing the red tinted mesh selected. Then &amp;ldquo;CTRL&amp;#43;A&amp;rdquo; pressed on the keyboard, bringing a menu on top of the screen, where the mouse is. That submenu is called &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; and has a list of commands like Apply&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Location, Rotation, Scale&amp;rdquo; etc. One of those is &amp;ldquo;All Transformation&amp;rdquo; and we select that.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;362px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With All Transformation applied, if your mesh is still red, go back into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. Press &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; to select all faces. Then press &amp;ldquo;CTRL + N&amp;rdquo; to open the &amp;ldquo;Normals&amp;rdquo; context menu. From it pick the top option - &amp;ldquo;Flip&amp;rdquo;. The mesh will then turn blue. You can go back to Object Mode and disable the &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; coloration from the viewport menu seen few steps before.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Mesh is now in Edit Mode and as such the image shows it with a wireframe on top. Its all orange, as its been selected by pressing &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; to select all faces. Image shows a &amp;ldquo;Normals&amp;rdquo; submenu brought up as described above. Top command in it is &amp;ldquo;Flip&amp;rdquo; and thats what we press.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;F3&amp;rdquo; to open &amp;ldquo;Operator Search&amp;rdquo; (some people bind this to Space Bar on keyboard). In the search type &amp;ldquo;Unwrap&amp;rdquo; and select it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you need more context as to what the - Menu Search - or - Operator Search - is and how to open it, check out the link to the official Blender Docs that I&amp;#39;ve put below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are done! Your UVs should look like below and they are exactly what we need. We are all wrapped up with the geometry section of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes the geometry we need. You can export you Static Mesh as you usually do, and import it in Unreal. If you are using Unreal 5, then tick &amp;ldquo;Import as Nanite&amp;rdquo; off, as we need this as ordinary static geometry. We will explain why that is in the next parts of the tutorial. That is where we will cover how to created the textures necessary and then how to assemble the Unreal material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part of the tutorial: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It covers creating the textures necessary for the VFX. We will be working in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
