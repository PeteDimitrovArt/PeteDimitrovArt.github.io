[{"content":"Findings On 1 Oct 2024, AMD released WHQL AMD Adrenalin Edition 24.9.1. That driver version breaks Lumen in Unreal Engine 5 and in Fortnite.\nLater that month, on 19 Oct 2024, AMD released version 24.10.1. It failed to fix the issue and as such as of the time of writing this, Lumen is still broken on latest GPU driver versions.\nIf you are working inside UE5, you would want to downgrade to 24.8.1 which on GPUs like mine, an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, fixes the issue.\nIf interested, read my findings below and watch the videos that showcase further evidence.\nIntro Last year, I spent lots of my free time working on a personal environment art scene in UE5. I went through Unreal Engine 5 Early Preview to UE5.0 and from all versions between and up to UE5.3. For that, I was using the same Radeon RX 7900 XTX as well.\nIn those months, and all those frequent engine updates, I have seen all kinds of behaviour, bugs and amusing findings when it comes to Nanite and Lumen.\nAll in all, with each update, newer changes made performance better. Visual presentation was improved too. If light leaks or other visual issues showed up, in the versions after, they were quickly patched.\nMeanwhile, I went through a lot of driver versions for the AMD Radeon gpu as well. All of which were mostly trouble free.\nAs such, my experience, both with improvements on AMD\u0026rsquo;s end and on Epic\u0026rsquo;s end, has been positive.\nFast forward to the past weeks when I finally made it back into UE5 after a break. I re-opened my old scene, the one that had had no large issues (or any that were there, I had found good ways to fix). I was met by this:\nVideo embedded above. It showcases three clips cut one after the other. First one displays a scene in UE5.4.4 with Software Lumen enabled. Second video is UE5.4.4 again but this time Hardware Lumen is on. The visuals are the same (faulty and leaking). Finally, the video cuts to a laggy footage from Fortnite where in a dark barn the same Lumen light leaking is observed. If you watch the above video to the very end, you will see me experience the same issue in a dark interior barn in Fortnite (my FPS there is low because my OBS glitched, but whilst playing my performance was fine, only the visual glitch showed).\nI felt like something must be fundamentally wrong for the light to be in such a bad state now. You can see it again in the still image below.\nI explored turning on and off Hardware Raytraced Lumen. Between it and software one there were no differences and both looked glitched. I decided to look a bit further into it and with some serendipity I found the culprit.\nInvestigation AMD Driver 24.6.1 I rolled back my drivers to WHQL 24.6.1 dated as 27 June 2024.\nI headed into Fortnite. I went inside the same barn I conduct all tests in (zone called Freaky Fields).\nThis is the behaviour and footage that I captured:\nVideo embedded above. Similar clip to before, but this time around the footage is recorded on gpu driver version 24.6.1. The interior of the dark barn no longer glitches in white flashes with the flick of the player camera. I went inside the depot of my project. UE5 editor settings and scalability are identical to before (to when I was using driver version 24.10.1). This is what I observed:\nVideo embedded above. A clip of the environment with my crystal inside UE5.4.4. The footage is recorded on driver version 24.6.1 and when the camera flicks around in an aggressive manner, there are no bugs or visual presentation artifacts. AMD Drivers 24.7.1 On 19 July 2024 AMD released AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.7.1.\nBack then, I installed the update, paying particular interest on one change in the list in particular:\nFixed Issues and Improvements\nImprovements to stutter when AMD Radeon™ Anti-Lag and AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution 3 frame generation is enabled. Improvements to stutter while playing Fortnite with DirectX® 12 API. Texture corruption may be observed while playing TEKKEN™ 8 with Ray Tracing or Upscale enabled. Corruption may be observed while playing Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition with Radeon™ Boost enabled. Intermittent system crash or corruption may be observed while playing Marvel\u0026rsquo;s Guardians of the Galaxy with Ray Tracing enabled. Virtual Super Resolution or Display Color Enhancements may be set to disabled after driver upgrade. Unable to change display pixel format with certain Windows display languages. Intermittent black corruption may be observed on scaled 3d models while using Origin or OriginPro application. Black corruption may be observed while fast forwarding using PotPlayer. ― 19 July 2024, AMD The one mentioning Fortnite drew my attention as it claimed that stutter in Fortnite had been improved. The game has always suffered by that and I wanted to see how much it has improved.\nAfter installing the driver and going into the game, my conclusion was that stutter had indeed been reduced, though not fully eliminated. Shaders compiled much faster at launch of the game (and entering my first match). While in the game, it was obvious when on-demand shader compilation was happening. Nonetheless, that felt improved too, and the stutter was lower than the previous few months of drivers and game versions.\nI thought that I remembered this was the first time I also saw visual light issues bigger than usual.\nHowever, I now went back and tested. I found out that 24.7.1 does not break Lumen.\nVideo embedded above. It shows my crystal scene interior. The camera flicks around and there are no visual glitches like seen before.. AMD Drivers 24.8.1 I went further up, now to driver version 24.8.1. This video showcases my tests both in UE5 Editor and in Fortnite.\nVideo embedded above. It shows the dark, blue crystal interior. Camera moves quick but there are no issues. Next, a clip from Fortnite barn cuts. All is fine there too.. No issues seen neither in UE5 nor in Fortnite above.\nAMD Drivers 24.9.1 Next, I went to 24.9.1. This release, dated at 1 Oct 2024 is the first time when things break.\nLighting Issues Start Fortnite had always had noise in the Lumen global illumination updating. It is a game where you can dynamically destroy structures after all. That changes the way light interacts with the environment by big sways. Yet, since the moment the game updated from UE4 to UE5 some years ago, I always thought it did the GI real time updates relatively well, when it comes to visual presentation.\nThere was noise, there was \u0026ldquo;lag\u0026rdquo; in the visuals of the light. There were small leaks in the modular pieces of the buildings and the interiors. Yet, there weren\u0026rsquo;t many \u0026ldquo;big\u0026rdquo; offenders.\nIn this update 24.9.1 all of that had changed. Lots of the lights, when in the open, looked like they were increased way too much in intensity. As if their art direction was lacking.\nLooking away from those problematic lights, when going quickly from exterior zone to an interior zone, you could see tons of white noise on the screen, as if Lumen struggles to keep up with your movement. Something that had never been in such a bad visual state before.\nVideo embedded above. When the camera moves swiftly inside the interior in UE5, the lights now break. Next, clip cuts to the dark interior in Fortnite. There things break too. AMD Driver 24.10.1 Everything I described above as issues can be seen in this clip too. In this one, we are on latest, current as of the time of writing this driver version 24.10.1.\nVideo embedded above. It showcases a clip from Fortnite. There is a dark barn interior. Player looks in one corner, then their camera flicks to the other corner. Suddenly the interior gets flooded with white, glitched light. Captured on AMD driver version 24.10.1, as explained by the green text on screen. The visual glitch seen above looks identical to 24.9.1. I\u0026rsquo;ve not included the 24.10.1 video from inside my UE5 scene here again simply because you already saw it in the intro of the post.\nFortnite Screen Message After doing most of my research, I found out about this warning, that pops up on launch of Fortnite, if you were on driver version 24.9.1 or 24.10.1 and using AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX:\nIt reads:\n\u0026ldquo;WARNING: Known issues with graphics driver\nThe installed version of the AMD graphics driver has known issues in D3D12. Please install the recommended driver version or switch to a different rendering API.\nWould you like to visit the following URL to download the driver?\nhttps://www.amd.com/en/support\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX Installed: AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition 24.10.1 Recommended: 24.8.1 (5000-series GPUs and above) or 24.9.1 (pre 5000-series GPUs)\u0026rdquo;\nThis perfectly aligns with my findings. It would be amazing if this type of message were to appear on opening of Unreal Engine 5, for users with hardware like mine. It\u0026rsquo;s very useful in Fortnite, but it seems it would be amazing in UE5 as well, in my opinion.\nConclusion WHQL AMD Adrenalin Edition 24.9.1 driver (dated 1 Oct 2024) broke some part of Lumen and resulted in light leaking and visual artifacts on screen update.\nThe issue observed is severe. It is present in both hardware enhanced ray tracing Lumen and in software based Lumen. Changing scalability settings of the engine or the game (Fortnite) do not seem to alleviate it.\nAny of the drivers that come after, in the following one month have the same issue. None resolved it (namely 24.10.1 released 19 Oct 2024).\nRolling back drivers to WHQL AMD Adrenalin Edition 24.8.1 (dated 29 August 2024) resolves the issue.\nRollback Methodology I download the old driver packages from the AMD website.

In order to find the source of the trouble, one needs to profile both their CPU and their GPU intensive processes. Different things we do in an engine, mechanics or visuals that we implement can end up on the CPU or on the GPU. We could have a perfect performance on one of those, but if the other one is lacking, we will be negatively bound to it. That is what we mean when we try to analyze whether we are CPU-bound or GPU-bound in a game.\nOver the years I\u0026rsquo;ve seen many student\u0026rsquo;s projects that are not supposed to be mechanically or visually complex, but simple and elegant on purpose. They are just blockouts of 3D spaces that are a \u0026ldquo;Level Design\u0026rdquo; exercise more than anything else. In their project, though, the student will still struggle with performance.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a mostly a sketch, level design blockout, yet the FPS is low. Why?\nCulprits There are many reasons that could cause the issues. One would need to in detail profile their project in order to find the specifics.\nWhen it comes to student works though, there are some culprits that I often see repeated again and again. As such we could make an educated guess and say that, as a student, the project you are working in right now, might have exactly one of those issues.\nThose four main reasons are:\nblocking out using BSP Brushes; blocking out by making blueprint actors; creating a loot item that has an animation on the CPU; using lots of overlapping lights. The first three are actually the same issue, disguised differently. That is the problem of \u0026ldquo;draw calls\u0026rdquo;. We will look into that next.\nGame Engines Engine:\nThe examples we show in this blog are mostly in UE5. If we were doing things in UE4 the situation would be nearly identical. Nanite in UE5 handles draw calls better than UE4 but most of the explanations I mention as culprits for low performance cannot be fully alleviated by Nanite. As such the issue persists.\nUnity:\nIn my student days, I didn\u0026#39;t know about a lot of these tech issues that I\u0026#39;m about to describe here. I learned about the culprits and how to resolve them back in my first industry job. It was an indie game dev studio. In there, I actually worked in Unity. Even though Unity can be quite different from UE5 in some aspects, lots of the fundamentals are the same. If you are learning and working with Unity right now, you would still benefit from reading this blog post.\nIssues Explored: Draw Calls The biggest issue that I most often find in students projects is mismanagement of draw calls. This one is so prevalent that I think it can be found often in indie projects out there too. Those are projects that are done by experienced people who might not have found good ways to manage their draw calls yet either.\nDraw calls is a topic that is not very often discussed at universities and schools either. As such it creeps as a mistake in so many game prototypes (and some finished, released games too).\nDraw call:\nA draw call is a request going through the CPU, that will inform the GPU what object to render and how to render it. The request comes with a bundle of information like position, scale, material IDs, material usage and more. It can be for a single object or a batch of objects.\nIn larger game companies, knowledge and experience flows freely, and as such when it comes to their games there will often be people, or custom tools, that will directly optimize and look at the draw calls footprint through the different stages of the project.\nThe way most engines work is through common and easy tactics that when applied will have your many objects on the screen end up in batches of draw calls. That way the scene gets optimized and the number of draw calls is controlled.\nThe goal is to always keep our draw calls amount low.\nBut there are some things you might do that will hardly ever batch. Those things will skyrocket your draw calls amount:\nBSP Brushes One case study for an easy way to skyrocket your draw calls (thats very bad) in both UE5 and UE4 is through the usage of BSP Brushes.\nHere are a few example screenshots from my environment project \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo;, 2018.\nIn the image above, my project is in early blockout. I love doing my measurements and shapes exploration for the different buildings through BSP brushes. But there is a giant drawback to using BSP brushes. If I am not careful and aware of it, I could easily create a larger blockout that then has incredibly poor performance.\nImagine the things seen above, but suddenly duplicated many times and blocking out a level that is few kilometers wider, instead of the smaller section of level seen above. The poor performance created by the BSPs will then even be exponentially higher.\nIn the image above, we see a later dev stage where I have already replaced all of my BSP brushes for actual static geometry, created in Blender (or Maya, which I used back in those years). By replacing the BSPs, I fixed my performance. A lot of blockouts and students projects never get to a stage of replacing BSPs for static geo. That is understandable - the BSPs serve a perfect purpose and the level created is a level design blockout, not something that needs to have finished set dressing. It\u0026rsquo;s not wanted to replace the brushes.\nBut by not replacing the BSPs, we\u0026rsquo;ve left in the scene a type of actor that carries an incredibly high amount of draw calls.\nIssue\nBSP Brushes cary a lot of information in them that gives them their custom dimensions. For example, a parallelepiped is represented by the length of each of its sides. In the options of the BSP we can change any of those sizes dynamically. We are given lots of freedom for iteration. That freedom comes at the cost of draw calls. Each object has more than one draw call (due to the dimension options in it). Each object is unique too, which makes it impossible to batch any draw calls.\nSolution\nBSP Brushes can be baked down (also called merge). They can be converted into a finalized, static geometry, that cannot be dynamically changed in dimensions. Through that bake, the draw calls are reduced to low amounts.\nMerge Down BSP Brushes The easiest way to win back our good performance, when using BSP brushes that we intend to keep in the level, is to bake down the BSPs.\nStep-by-step how-to for merging down BSPs:\nSelect the BSP Actor that you want to turn into ordinary static geometry; In the right hand menu, look in the \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; of the Brush component; Click on \u0026ldquo;Advanced\u0026rdquo;; Press \u0026ldquo;Create Static Mesh\u0026rdquo;; Pick the location to save it; Done. Engine does the rest. The engine will save a new static mesh that is in the shape of your BSP. It will also replace your old \u0026ldquo;Brush Component\u0026rdquo; for a \u0026ldquo;Static Mesh Actor\u0026rdquo; that has more efficient draw calls and is the result of the bake down we just did.\nThe steps, illustrated:\nSelect the brush geo. Expand \u0026ldquo;Advanced\u0026rdquo; tab. Press \u0026ldquo;Create Static Mesh\u0026rdquo;.\nSelect where to save. Press \u0026ldquo;Create Static Mesh\u0026rdquo; (blue button seen above).\nHere you can see that now your component type is \u0026ldquo;Static Mesh\u0026rdquo;. We turned the \u0026ldquo;Brush Component\u0026rdquo; (has lots of draw calls) into \u0026ldquo;Static Mesh Component\u0026rdquo; (has manageable, lower amount of draw calls).\nYou can go over your scene and do that for each unique type of geometry shape you\u0026rsquo;ve created. After turning one shape into a static geometry, replace any other BSPs visually similar to it for the newly created static geometry.\nProof But we jumped to the solution above, without me presenting any evidence. Lets say that before you went through all of the ordeal of merging and baking down your geometry, you wanted to see proof that indeed BSP brushes are as bad as I describe them to be. Here is some:\ncmd\nstat scenerendering\nEasiest way to see some evidence is to analyze the draw calls amounts on a screen at a given time and compare it to the same screen but with some of the \u0026ldquo;static mesh\u0026rdquo; actors swapped instead for \u0026ldquo;BSP brush\u0026rdquo; actors.\nWhat we expect to see, given all of the reasoning I went through so far, is that the \u0026ldquo;static mesh\u0026rdquo; actors filled screen will be low on draw calls. The screen filled with \u0026ldquo;BSP brush\u0026rdquo; actors instead will be incredibly high on draw calls.\nWe can do exactly that by using the console command seen above, inside Unreal.\nClick on the cmd seen above and start typing. Write:\n1 stat scenerendering Then hit \u0026ldquo;Enter\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. A profiling window in green colors will show up on the screen.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve circled the line above which we are after on this newly popped up \u0026ldquo;Scene Rendering\u0026rdquo; profiling screen. We can see that Mesh draw calls are max 53.00 and min 5.00. That is expectedly low amount given that right now our camera frustum (viewing frustum) is looking at a mostly empty corner of the level.\nExample Now lets look at a part of the screen with some static meshes and BSP brushes.\nImage above showcases a scene with a few assets of type \u0026ldquo;Static Mesh\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce we do \u0026ldquo;stat scenerendering\u0026rdquo; on the screen we see that the mesh draw calls of this scene are low. Average of 19.92 and max of 29.00 (seen above).\nNext up, in image above, we add a bunch of BSP brush actor types to the scene. Those are in the form of various geometry primitives but the important part is that they are BSP brushes.\nOnce we again do \u0026ldquo;stat scenerendering\u0026rdquo; on the screen above, we see that now our draw calls have sky-rocketed. On average they are 951.62 and on max they even go as high as 1,916.00.\nThis large number, as explained already, is due to the BSP brushes.\nIn this final figure, we have top row images (a) and (b), consisting of the scene full of BSP Brushes.\nIn the bottom row, images (c) and (d), we have used the technique described in this blog post and have turned the BSP brushes actors into static meshes.\nThe visuals between (a) and (c) are identical. Yet the scene in (b) that had BSP brushes has average of 951.62 draw calls. The scene with only static meshes, seen in (d), has 82.48.\nConclusion from comparison above:\nBSP Brushes, as seen above introduce lots of needless draw calls. Keep your level blockouts and your environment art scenes free of them by converting to static meshes and your performance will be much higher.\nBlueprint Actors Short explanation Did you intend to use some geometry as static? Did you turn it into a blueprint because you wanted to attach something else that is static to it? If yes, then turning it into a blueprint might have turned it into \u0026ldquo;movable\u0026rdquo; geometry that then has increased draw calls and can\u0026rsquo;t bundle in draw calls with instances (copies in the level) of itself.\nAs such, go into the newly made blueprint with static art set dressings and make sure you set the root and the children geometry inside all as \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo;. All solved!\nLong explanation Working with Blueprints is a smart thing to do. It definitely is the right approach no matter if you are doing level design, mechanics or environment art and set dressing.\nEven though a lot of people who start in Unreal for the first time might not see the use of Blueprints past gameplay and mechanics, there is in fact lots to extract from blueprints when doing set dressing.\nWhen making environment art, it can sometimes be slow to work directly into the world, in world space. You create a building and it is placed at an odd angle in the level. Every set dressing that might go onto its exterior, on its façade, you need to place at a similarly odd angle. An easier way to work instead would be to create \u0026ldquo;local space\u0026rdquo;. A bundle of assets - the buildings and its façade set dressings - placed in its own coordinates. That is exactly a blueprint. That \u0026ldquo;local space\u0026rdquo; bundle, then like a little template can be placed in the world, at an odd angle. It\u0026rsquo;s creation, through a blueprint, instead of directly working in \u0026ldquo;world space\u0026rdquo; was much easier.\n(Below I made a silly looking house as a quick example. Ignore the fact it doesn\u0026#39;t look amazing. I used Unreal starter project meshes with the idea of illustrating the explanations here a bit better.)\nIf you are working with multiple people and there is version control, this means you don\u0026rsquo;t need to commit changes to the world (the level) next time you want to improve the building. Instead you can edit the blueprint (the local space) and commit that change. The fixes and improvements will automatically propagate to every level where the blueprint was used.\nHopefully this paints a picture of why its great to work with blueprints in order to build \u0026ldquo;templates\u0026rdquo; of environment art and set dressing. In the image below is seen one such template.\nIf you do the above, here comes the issue though, and the reason why you might have low performance next.\nAs seen above, the default settings when making a blueprint will set every static geometry inside to \u0026ldquo;movable\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo;. As mentioned before, that increases draw calls. It\u0026rsquo;s also needless, as these pieces will be used as environment art that doesn\u0026rsquo;t ever move. We can fix it all by changing the mobility back to static, as seen in the next images.\nYellow text above reads \u0026ldquo;We need to change the mobility from \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo;. This way draw calls will be manageable. In this step we changed the root and next we need to also change the mobility of any meshes under it as well.\nImage above instructs:\nNext we should select all children under the root. Then we change their \u0026ldquo;Mobility\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; as well. A yellow arrow points to where to do that in the blueprint details panel. Save the blueprint file changes and all is done. We are now all optimized on draw calls.\nWith all set to static, all is good and manageable in draw calls. Always pay attention to your mobility settings for new Blueprints and you will not have further performance issues related to the BPs.\nMoving Drops and Loot You\u0026rsquo;ve created a little game prototype. It consists mostly of blockout levels without any heavy graphics. You are a person interested in level design, as well as game design for gameplay mechanics and gameplay systems.\nYour game prototype world is just the mentioned above: blockouts. You have also added some enemies and simple loot that spawns when the minions die. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve also scattered and placed some predefined collectables in your level.\nFor a collectable to be easily spotted by the player, and for it to look interesting and like we could interact with it, you\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give it a simple animation. Something like the rotation around main pivot point, as seen by the colorful, little gems in Spyro.\nYou like rewarding players and giving them sense of satisfaction and progression. As such you shower them in loot. Soon the level you have is packed with lots and lots of rotating in place items. Your FPS is down.\nIf all of the above is the case, and if indeed your performance is low, then the reason might be exactly in the loot. More specifically, in the way you did the simple animation associated with it.\nThere are two ways you could approach making this animation. One is through a Blueprint Actor that has moving component that gives the item a rotation on each game tick through the blueprint logic. The second way is through a custom material shader (Material Graph) that rotates the loot through World Position Offset. There is also a third way, through an animation created in Blender or Maya and imported, but we will ignore that because most students and devs will prefer to do something as simple as rotation around pivot inside the engine itself, instead of going outside of it.\nFor your FPS to be down, you\u0026rsquo;ve most likely picked the first option. You\u0026rsquo;ve created your loot as a blueprint that gets placed in a static location in the world. That blueprint then has the logic to rotate the item around, or make it hover up and down. By doing it through the blueprint you\u0026rsquo;ve inadvertently increased your draw calls by causing each placed instance of the loot to be a unique draw call.\n💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎\nThe culprit here:\nTo make the item animate through a blueprint, you set the geometry to \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo;; A \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; game object always ends up in its own draw call; Introduce hundreds of those. They wont stack into one draw call, they will be hundreds of draw calls. If instead you animate the object through the Material Graph, using World Position Offset (WPO) then your animation will end up being on the GPU. All objects using the material that animates them could be left to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; and still visually animate in movement. All of those objects would then bundle in draw calls.\nYou would no longer be making hundreds and hundreds of needless draw calls that slow down your CPU.\nYour performance will increase. Your FPS will be higher.\n💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎\nVideo embedded above. Title is \"Rotating Objects in UE4, Benchmarked (Get better FPS!)\" by YouTuber \"Pending Kill\". The video is an excellent showcase of how one could do the different types of animation and what their performance would be. This video is the best showcase, and explanation, of everything I wrote above. I found it some time ago randomly and was very impressed by the great presentation in it. Give it a watch to learn more.\nThe showcase is in UE4 but the inner workings are the same in UE5. As such if you found yourself making rotating loot, all of this info is still valid. It\u0026rsquo;s also the same way in Unity.\nOverlapping Lights Another aspect that can be incredibly influential over your performance is light. Depending on how you use \u0026ldquo;Point Lights\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Spotlights\u0026rdquo; in your project, you might end up with a lot of overlaps in light that increase the cost of the light actors and drag down your performance.\nNo matter if we are in UE5, UE4 or Unity, we need to be careful with movable, overlapping lights, and we need to be intelligent with the way we place those actors in the world.\nThe goal is to always keep overlaps in lights low. Light actors should be placed with sensible attenuation radius and should not be stacked over one another, even when they have small radius.\nLights Example When we are talking about lighting that is realistic and looks cinematic and moody, the general artistic comment of \u0026ldquo;less is more\u0026rdquo; is even stronger than other mediums of art. As such, if we set up lighting in a smart way, we will get a better artistic visual through using less amount of point lights and spotlights. That will then result in better performance too, thanks to the already mentioned reasons.\nBut lets explore some visual examples of lights overlapping. For that I will take a look at my project \u0026rdquo;The Amarantos Ritual\u0026quot; (check the link to read about its making!).\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rTwo images overlaid on top of one another. First screenshot shows the final scene - blue crystal in the middle of a ruined interior full of roots and blue flowers. Secondary image overlays 2D sprites that showcase the point lights, spotlights and rectangular lights used. In the comparison images above we first see the final scene. The secondary screenshot overlays on top the billboards of the lights, showcasing their position in the world.\nIf with the UE5 scene open, we click on the viewport and then we press \u0026ldquo;ALT + 7\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard, we will go into \u0026ldquo;Light Complexity\u0026rdquo;. That is an \u0026ldquo;Optimization Viewmode\u0026rdquo;. In the secondary image below, we can see lots of blue, green and red colors. That\u0026rsquo;s the light complexity view mode.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rFirst is the image seen before - the UE5 scene with the crystal, 2D sprites showing lights toggled. Second image on top is a -Light Complexity- view mode. It shows the scene in flat silhouettes. Those are colored between deep blue, green, yellow, orange, red and purple and white. Each color corresponds to a complexity in the light, dragging performance down. Transcription to what each color represents is in the following paragraph below. The legend of how to read the view mode comes in the form of the long, color gradient bar in the lower parts of the screen. It reads as:\nDeep blues to light blues - little overlaps; Green to yellow - medium overlaps; Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps; Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps. Or in flashy, absolutely needless, colors that I spend way too long writing code for, given that I will probably never reuse in the future of this blog (I mean, behold how ugly it is!):\n1. Deep blues to light blues - little overlaps;\n2. Green to yellow - medium overlaps;\n3. Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps;\n4. Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps.\nThe bigger amount of lights affecting a surface (overlapping there), the more expensive to render that surface becomes. The colors indicate that:\nBlue - surface only affected by your Directional Light. Green - surface affected by your Dir Light + one more light. \u0026hellip;.. Red - surface affected by up to 5 different lights. When we are working on our lighting set up, we want to check this light complexity view mode from time to time. That is in order to track if we get big \u0026ldquo;offenders\u0026rdquo; in overlapping lights. If we see any, we want to select the light and under its settings tweak the \u0026ldquo;Attenuation Radius\u0026rdquo; down.\nIn the gif below, we can see me doing exactly that with two point lights:\nNote how in the middle of the gif above playing, when spectating the optimization view mode, the colors change from purples and whites to bit more reds. That is the frame where I selected two Point Lights. They had \u0026ldquo;Attenuation Radius\u0026rdquo; setting of 300. I toned them down to a radius of 100.\nIf you observe the change between the final frame and the first one, you see before-and-after. Indeed there is a difference in how the lighting looks. But the lesson here is that there are lots of situation in which you might needlessly have a large amount of attenuation radius. If you go into the setting and dial it down slowly, you might see that the first many numbers you go down through might not change the visual at all. But in the background, it will change the overlap in light and it will optimize your scene further.\nLights Art Control Lets mention the \u0026ldquo;less is more\u0026rdquo; part again though.\nI want to point out once more, that when we have less amount of lights in a scene, they are actually artistically easier to direct and control. As such a well lit, moody and beautiful scene, will more often be build up of the elegance of a few large lights, as opposed to a constellation of many tiny lights.\nKeep that in mind and study movies and cinematic direction in order to learn how to see the simplicity and elegance of use of light in broad strokes, instead of tiny ones. That will make you better at lighting as art, but it will coincidentally make your scenes more optimized as well.\nReference is queen here so you always want to find good photographs and movie stills to base your lighting work off of.\nBaked Lights In a more old-fashioned lighting set up, where one relies on stationary lights that will be baked, overlapping lights might not be nearly as big of an issue. That set up is commonly seen in UE4 and Unity.\nAs already explored, in a more modern lighting set up, where nearly all of the lights are movable and will not be baked at all, overlapping lights can have a detrimental affect on your performance. This lighting set up is what we most commonly see in UE5 and Lumen.\nEven if you project is in UE5, if you are a student that is looking to expand their knowledge and find their first break into the industry, I would say that its worth looking up how to create good lightmaps for assets. Those lightmaps will then allow you, with the right settings, to bake most of your lights in your scene.\nLots of next gen games that are build in UE5 don\u0026rsquo;t use baked lights. But lots of games still use baked lights (for example most projects I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on over at Rebellion). The technique is incredibly good and beneficial, with little drawbacks to the art and big wins in the performance, when done the right way. As such its something commonly found in lots of studios out there and you having some knowledge in it will put you ahead of a lot of other candidates that might compete with you in a job search.\nGPU Profiling Tool You can see how well, or bad, your lights are performing directly into the GPU profiler tool that Unreal provides as well.\nThis tool is incredibly beneficial as it lists the costs to anything that ends up on the GPU. In the cases where you know that your graphics are dragging you down, and that you might be GPU-bound, you can use that screen to analyze what needs improving.\nJust like the time we clicked the Unreal cmd in the lower left corner of the screen to type \u0026ldquo;stat scenerendering\u0026rdquo; we can now use it to instead call this GPU tool.\nClick the cmd and type \u0026ldquo;Profile GPU\u0026rdquo;.\n1 profile gpu Then hit \u0026ldquo;Enter\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. The profiler window will open.\nIn the first image above, we can see that there is a long bar colored in different regions. Each of those represents a different cost that is on the GPU. Hovering over the teal-green colored section in my case, I saw that its listed as \u0026ldquo;Lights\u0026rdquo;.\nI clicked on that and it expanded into the image below:\nAfter selecting to take a closer look at the lights, we can see them listed in the category below. If the ms listed in this category is very high, then the performance is bad and your FPS will be low.\nApart from the lights, this tool allows you to nicely observe if there are other performance issues as well.\nAn example from an old project of mine is one time when I was having incredibly poor FPS. I ran the GPU Profiler Viz and I could see that the \u0026ldquo;Hair Groom\u0026rdquo; actors associated with my Metahuman in the scene was giving incredibly hard time to my GTX 1070. I disabled the hair, put a helmet on the metahuman, and started saving up for a newer gen GPU that could handle it.\nConclusion In this lengthy blog post, we explore common reasons for low performance in projects. That is in both environment art projects and level design blockouts.\nWe looked at some ideas of how to handle and fix the issues. We explored draw calls, static meshes and BSP brushes. We looked at how to convert BSP brushes into static meshes that are more manageable in draw calls.\nNext we looked at blueprints actors and how faulty default settings might cause high draw calls. From there we went into animating simple drop. Finally we explored lights and what overlapping lights are.\nThe tooling that we explored, like the \u0026ldquo;scenerendering\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;GPU profiler\u0026rdquo; are incredibly powerful. I mentioned some ways to look at those and analyze your work. The screens list lots and lots more useful data though. It\u0026rsquo;s data that is too much to explore in a single blog post. As such I shall leave you to analyze and perfect your performance further by looking at all of that.\nOne final thing that I would like to mention, that we didn\u0026rsquo;t get the time to cover in this post either, is that what we do in blueprints when it comes to scripting and to logic behind implementing gameplay, can of course, also affect performance.\nAs such make sure you not only spend your energy profiling your graphics, but try to optimize and make sure the logic of your blueprints, code and gameplay is also well created.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

Along with those, I also created some props showcase and breakdown images. In The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt, I already covered quite a bit of insight and behind-the-scenes early images of how I approached creating the geometry for the Nanite crystal. I also showed many screenshots of the progress on the texturing and my reasoning behind the way I approached it.\nIn the other ten entries of “The Amarantos Ritual” dev blogs, I showed and told you about everything I wanted when it comes to this project. There are even few parts that are tutorials. As such, I am wrapping up the series. Even though the “Crystal Sculpt” blog above is very detailed, I thought I would create this as a supplement blog to it.\nAs such if you are interested in creating a crystal prop like it, go over and read entry four, \u0026ldquo;Crystal Sculpt\u0026rdquo;, above and then come back here and complement your knowledge with the additional four image breakdowns on the topic. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s informative and insightful.\nScreenshots Some screenshots of the final result. This is what we will be inspecting a breakdown of in the images to come.\nBreakdown Text and breakdown behind each image is transcribed below (which was another reason I made this blog post - to transcribe the text for better accessibility).\nThe crystal prop has two material IDs. 1/ Red color - crystal shards. 2/ Green color - rock orb.\nNeither utilize high- to low-poly bake or normal bakes. Both benefit from AO and curvature bake. Those were made by baking “low on low” (in this case we are talking about a dense Nanite mesh).\nSubstance Painter work for crystal (red) includes:\ntriplanar mapping of some base color noises (the liquid-spill shapes); hand polish by painting seams and liquid-spill parts that didn’t come out looking detailed even with triplanar mapping; AO multiplied into the base color for an extra punch of darkness detail; Roughness variation derived from AO and curvature bakes. Substance Painter work for crystal (green) includes:\nOrdinary PBR texturing utilizing normal noise from rock texture, base color, AO and roughness. Blue shards attached to it were masked by hand too. The image above then shows a close up of the blue crystal, rendered in UE5. Text next to it reads:\nCrystal UVs all point in a uniform direction. That way any tiling detail normals / roughness and other channels used in UE5 would get the best appearance. Texel density is uniform too. UVs were created and polished by hand. Laid out with UV Packmaster 2. (Blender)\nFinal two images in the picture above then show an albedo close up of the patterns painted on the crystal. In the first image there are seams, in the second one they are painted away. Text next to those reads:\nBefore (left) and after (right). An example of a quick by hand painting to improve seams.\nCrystal material ID (red) seen in this shot (blue image above with white splash in the middle). This one is the more detailed and a special one. It tiles a micro and a macro normals as well as a roughness tiled channel. In addition it has two fresnels.\nRock orb material ID (green) seen in this shot (gray image above). Is ordinary PBR with nothing special going on.\nFresnel[1] off (top left). Fresnel[1] on (top right). This is the inverted fresnel. Gives crystal shine from afar.\nFresnel[2] off (bottom first image in collage above). Fresnel[2] on (bottom second image in collage above). Is not inverted. Has lower power but more obvious color. Gives the colorful edges (noticeable from both close and far).\nBoth Fresnels add lots of detail. They work especially well with the Nanite geometry. Seen to the left is an edge that exists in the geo but is mostly invisible and flat when colored with only an albedo. When an inverted Fresnel is added, that edge is especially pronounced and gives the visuals more dimensionality.\nTiling Normal [1] This first tiled normal detail acts mostly as macro detail. Thats in the form of gaussian dots and circular scratches. They appear large in their shape and tiling.\nTiling Normal [2] Second tiled normal detail acts mostly as micro detail. It gives the surface a crystal matrix pattern. It might look large on the left, but you can see on the right that its tiled over 28 times (making it tiny). My favourite part with this one is that when the camera goes further away and the texture mipmaps to a lower level, it gives the crystal a dotted, sparking visual.\nTiling Roughness As mentioned in page 1 (thats image one), the crystal has unique albedo, roughness and metallic. These are seen here: (green arrow points to albedo and AO_R_M texture slots in the material)\nI thought that not only the normals could benefit from tiling noise but that the roughness could get a bit of detail as well. As such this bitmap seen to the left, I multiplied into the AO_R_M of the crystal to give more richness.\nEmission and Animations On the very top group in the image above you can see lots of parameters relating to emission. They have one underlying design:\n1/ In Painter mask parts of the “liquid spill albedo”. Use that as unique “EmissiveMask” above.\n2/ Tile a big gaussian noise. (EmissivePannerMask)\n3/ Pan the noise in U and V direction, giving an animated look. (PanX and PanY Speed).\nThese are hard to show here and can be observed in the videos (seen in albums below).\nArtstation Albums You can find the images above, and many more, in 4k, over at my Artstation. I ended up creating three albums as I could organize the tons of screenshots better that way.\nEnvironment - https://www.artstation.com/artwork/04Ved8 Crystal Prop - https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Ke52ky Assets Breakdown - https://www.artstation.com/artwork/lD4Z4z Cinematic Together with Hayley Rumbold we also finished up our cinematic work a month and a bit ago. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t seen it, check it out here.\nVideo embedded above. Shows a UE5 cinematic video. The crystal prop and the environment are part of that. You can also see some behind the scenes images on the topic of the cinematic over at Hayley\u0026rsquo;s website.\nConclusion The four images showed a breakdown of how I accomplished to create a detailed crystal prop inside Unreal 5. The different pieces that make up the final visual were taken apart. Comparison of some effects being on and off were shown. Some of the bitmaps used were also previewed. With all of that, hopefully you learned something new and got ideas and inspiration of how to approach the geometry and texture work when it comes to your own props.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

It now sits right under the crystal in the middle of the room.\nIf you missed reading about how that VFX was created then you can follow and take a glance over here at this page. The tools used include Unreal, Substance Designer and Blender. The main driving force of the VFX is a polar coordinates distortion of UVs that is seen and widely used in games like Diablo IV, Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate and more. That is something that I showcase with examples from exactly those titles over at The Amarantos Ritual - 07 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Three. Take a look if you haven\u0026rsquo;t.\nLast Time If we look away from that VFX and check how the scene looked last time, we can find it in this state:\nHere it is now, with some additions I will go over and describe in this blog entry:\nComparing the two images above, you can see that I\u0026rsquo;ve build up further, more powerful blue color permeating through the scene. I did that through some light and through some new props and set dressings. Those include wider petal flowers on the vines and roots that crawl the walls. There are also new runes on the top parts of the inner walls and stronger blue symbols in the middle, square, broken pillars.\nI also made an animated Niagara VFX for shattered shards that spiral endlessly upwards in space. In some of the screenshots I show you might see those off, as I would disabled them here and there when their visual was getting into my way of working. But these were something I made with the intention of keeping at the end in order to give me more interest in the final beauty shots as well as in the cinematic we are creating with Hayley Rumbold.\nEndless Spiral Before I got into placing any shard static meshes for my spiral, I wanted to first block out its actual shape. As such in Niagara I started with the default sprite renderer. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter if the elements spawned were 2D billboards or 3D meshes for now. My advise for approaching any VFX is always to first sketch your spawning and your movement that creates your overall shape. Don\u0026rsquo;t focus on any little details like what is spawned, colors, meshes, rotations of those, etc.\nThis one above, a dense spiral, quite more visually busy than the image before, is what I had right at the start. Blocking it out made me realize I want the spiral to be less dense which meant it needed to be more skewed in Z upwards space.\nGlitched Look Only after I had the main spiral shape, I started trying to put in static meshes instead of the 2D blue dots. This screenshot above showcases the very first go where I had still not randomized the shard, its scale and its rotation.\nI managed to tweak the mesh spawner so it follows the spiral a bit better (seen above). Yet it was still not great and I started getting a glitched Windows XP window look.\nFinally, after some tweaks, I managed to make my Niagara do the following: pick and spawn 1 mesh randomly between a selection of 3. Scale it up or down randomly. Rotate it randomly. The result meant that some pieces of shards clip into others. As long as my scale was tweaked to be shards smaller than in the image seen above, there were no big clipping offenders. As in there were plenty happening, but could the viewer notice? Not really, unless they paid really, really close attention. As such I decided that its not worth it to spend my time into any clever solutions that would prevent from meshes to spawn clipped into one another.\nThe above was pretty much what I settled after the first tweaks. Later on, once Hayley started setting up her cinematic work cameras, I did further fixes here and there on the spawning, scale, etc. I did that so it fits better what she had needs of for the cinematic.\nFlowers The other important piece that I created, which came right after the making of the spiral, was the flower I mentioned at the start.\nGiven that my project was an experimentation and learning in UE5 and respectively Nanite and Lumen, it meant I could afford to create the flower entirely using geometry. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to spend time sculpting a flat petal in Zbrush and then baking it into an atlas to go onto foliage cards. Instead I just modelled my flower and its petals as thick, 3D pieces, straight inside Blender using a subdivision modifier workflow.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t leave my Catmull-Clark subdivision modifier to be needlessly high, I kept it relatively low, but it was still very nice to have something created so quickly and not to have to worry about polycount as you would outside of Nanite (in UE4 for example).\nMy initial texturing was a bit too bright in albedo and although it looked alien in a cool way, it was drawing too much attention. As such I tweaked it to be a bit darker like seen below.\nI also tried to give it a stronger normal map noise to give it leaf-like surface details. I think later in the project I also slightly tweaked the purple and pink grunge to not be as powerful.\nComparison Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rCamera angle looking at the ground. Image to the left shows the initial flowers that were pod shaped and had bright spotlights. Image to the right shows the after - the tweaks where the flowers are with petals and are blue. If you drag the bar in the middle of the picture above, you will see the \u0026ldquo;before\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;after\u0026rdquo;. In the initial versions the flowers had a bright spotlight-esque look. That made them very much in contrast compared to the environment and I think that was breaking the scene. In the second version, without such obvious lights, the shapes work much better.\nConclusion In this entry we saw the scene move forward thanks to some VFX and some flowers. Those introduced more blue hues that I then tied up with more blue runes and symbols on some of the pillars and walls. Overall that shifted the monotonous gray and low saturation green look away. It made the scene look a bit more alive and interesting.\nCredits Hayley Rumbold who I mentioned a few times in the post is my collaborator in the art in this project. She created the cinematic works for the short set in the environment. We will explore that in later posts.\nBlooper For the end of this post I will leave you with a \u0026ldquo;blooper\u0026rdquo; (not really, just an experiment I thought would be fun to try). It\u0026rsquo;s something I thought might be interesting but at the end abandoned as an idea as it was just way too busy and was overpowering the rest of my scene.\nI annotated it with:\nI made a biblically accurate crystal.\nIf it could whisper unsettling words, what would it murmur?\nYouTube embed above. Shows a clip from the scene where the crystal in the middle has multiple copies of it, rotated differently. They suddenly all start to shift and rotate in different directions, making it have an eerie symmetry and fascinating movement.

We have created the geometry, textures and then shaders necessary for getting the nice visual end result. We could leave it there. The VFX vision is accomplished.\nHowever, there is one final, optional step I wanted to run you through. It\u0026rsquo;s the set up of a custom Blueprint Actor and a few lines of Construction Script node logic.\nIf you would like to remind yourself of the previous tutorial steps, you can do so over here:\nPart One - Creating Static Geometry\nPart Two - Creating Textures\nPart Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader\nPart Four - Adding Refraction Shader and Assembling The Final VFX\nTip:\nAs in all parts of this tutorial series, I am working in UE5.3.

Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)\nThe Problem I like the visual result and the set up of our work so far. The VFX vortex basin looks cool. It looks how we wanted it. I have a \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; with a part of its set up that has nothing to do with the visuals though. I say \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; because its not a large issue per se.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s more about efficiency than about any \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo;. There is an overall lack of efficiency that shows up in a few ways. Lets look over it.\nNot Bundled For a started, our VFX basin is composed of four pieces:\nStatic vortex mesh with base color.\rStatic vortex mesh copy with refraction.\rMiddle small static mesh plane to fix imperfection.\rCylinder static mesh frame.\rAs such whenever I want to copy my visual into a new level, or make a duplicate in the existing level, I have to select all one by one, as seen in the image below.\nLets imagine a hypothetical situation where this asset is used in a full production game, where lots of artist work on the game. First, selecting one by one four assets, whenever you want to move things around is inefficient. Second, having to \u0026ldquo;instruct\u0026rdquo; and have other artists remember about your edge case VFX where its split into four pieces is also quite inefficient.\nThere is a solution to that. It is to turn the four pieces into a bundle. Into a Blueprint Actor. We will do that and cover the necessary steps. Any artist, designer or a programmer that later on has to work with this VFX basin, add functionality or do tweaks, will be thankful to us for bundling it properly into an actor.\nHard to Change Color If you remember from the previous steps, we made our main material shader so we can tint the VFX into any color we like. That is the reason why in part two of the tutorial series we left the \u0026ldquo;albedo\u0026rdquo; liquid-spill texture black and white - so we could tint it in engine.\nAs such, lets imagine another hypothetical situation with a game in full production. Let us say that this VFX basin is used as a portal or as some fundamental for gameplay function. As such it will exist everywhere. Lots of copies in each world. Also lets say that for visual variety, or even better, for design functionality, we have created a big array of lots of colored versions of this VFX basin. Its not going to be just blue, purple and green like the previews above.\nInstead its going to be blue, purple, green, violet, pink, red, yellow, cyan, a shade of black, a shade of white, and more. Also lets imagine that new artists or designers joining might want newer shades of colors, so they suddenly create even more. Our Content Browser ends up like this:\nI had the patience to make only 9 material instances to illustrate this point. But imagine there being 18, or 25 or even 30 material instances. Believe me, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen productions at previous game dev jobs I\u0026rsquo;ve had where this thing happens. I didn\u0026rsquo;t name the instances properly either - instead of having a color in the name, they just go _Inst1\u0026hellip;Inst2\u0026hellip;InstN. and I\u0026rsquo;ve seen that in studios out there too (make sure to always name things properly).\nThe Solution In order to make something more efficient and eliminate the two issues above, we can create a Blueprint Actor. In it, all static meshes will be into a collection, which fixes problem one. Then in the Construction Script of the blueprint, we can use few nodes of logic in order to make it so we have exposed and customizable color per blueprint actor instance once placed in the world.\nWe will end up with this.\nBlueprint Actor In your project directory, make a folder called \u0026ldquo;Blueprints\u0026rdquo;. Inside of it, right click to create a new asset. Under \u0026ldquo;Create Basic Asset\u0026rdquo;, select \u0026ldquo;Blueprint Class\u0026rdquo;. In the window that pops up, select the top option button, called \u0026ldquo;Actor\u0026rdquo;.\nFor a name of your Blueprint go for something easy to understand and follow like \u0026ldquo;BP_vortex_basin\u0026rdquo;. Open the newly created blueprint.\nAdding Components Find the static mesh you created in the first part of this tutorial series. From the \u0026ldquo;Content Drawer\u0026rdquo; drag it into the Blueprint.\nSelect the newly added mesh. On the right hand side panel, first change the \u0026ldquo;Mobility\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo;. Then click on the Material and find your vortex material instance, the one that has default white color tint on it.\nWith mobility set to static from the previous step, we can now click and hold the mesh on the left hand side of the screen and then drag it on top of \u0026ldquo;DefaultSceneRoot\u0026rdquo;.\nThe end result is this where we have no \u0026ldquo;DefaultSceneRoot\u0026rdquo;.\nSelect \u0026ldquo;SM_Basin_Tutorial1\u0026rdquo; (your top asset in the hierarchy to the left, the name might be different for you). Copy and paste it (do so by pressing CTRL + C and then CTRL + V immediately, while hovering the mouse over the hierarchy window oon the left). Select the second, new copy, in the hierarchy. Change its Z position to 4 by using the Details panel to the right.\nRename Rename your top asset to \u0026ldquo;SM_polar_vortex\u0026rdquo;. The child component (asset) under, rename to \u0026ldquo;SM_refraction_basin\u0026rdquo;. Select the refraction mesh and change its material to your transparent, refraction one from the previous part in this tutorial series.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; button below the \u0026ldquo;Components\u0026rdquo; in the top left corner. Select \u0026ldquo;Plane\u0026rdquo; from the \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; subcontext menu. Drag the plane to be under \u0026ldquo;SM_polar_vortex\u0026rdquo;. Change its Z location setting to \u0026ldquo;5\u0026rdquo;. For its \u0026ldquo;Mobility\u0026rdquo; change from \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; as per usual.\nRename your \u0026ldquo;Plane\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;SM_plane_polar\u0026rdquo;. Set its material to be the black and white polar one (identical to our SM_polar_vortex).\nDrag in your cylinder frame mesh (I do this by dragging the file from the project Content Drawer and onto the BP here). Position it so it fits well. Set it to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo; as usual.\nConstruction Script Double click on the \u0026ldquo;ConstructionScript\u0026rdquo; function that is listed in the image seen below (yellow arrow points at it).\nAfter double clicking on the \u0026ldquo;ConstructionScript\u0026rdquo; seen in the previous image, a new tab opens. If we want to go back on the top part of the screen, there is a tab called \u0026ldquo;Viewport\u0026rdquo; (we are not going back now, just saying).\nOn the left side, there is a category called \u0026ldquo;Components\u0026rdquo;. Expand it. Inside you will see the collection of \u0026ldquo;SM_\u0026rdquo; pieces you have in the blueprint.\nStart by dragging \u0026ldquo;SM_plane_polar\u0026rdquo; onto the board. Context menu with \u0026ldquo;Get\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Set\u0026rdquo; shows up after you drag. Select \u0026ldquo;Get\u0026rdquo;.\nThe previous step adds this node on the board, seen below - blue tinted \u0026ldquo;SM Plane Polar\u0026rdquo; named on. Repeat the same step but now drag \u0026ldquo;SM_Polar_Vortex\u0026rdquo; component from the left menu. Add it to the board.\nSet Vector Parameter Start dragging the pin out of \u0026ldquo;SM Plane Polar\u0026rdquo; blue node. Let go and this search seen below will appear. Type in \u0026ldquo;set vector parameter\u0026rdquo; and select \u0026ldquo;Set Vector Parameter Value on Materials\u0026rdquo; that will appear in the list.\nThis large node shows up (seen below).\nConnect the purple node to the \u0026ldquo;Set Vector\u0026rdquo; blue one (I\u0026rsquo;ve highlighted it in yellow, broken line below). Connect \u0026ldquo;SM Polar Vortex\u0026rdquo; into \u0026ldquo;Target\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;Sec Vector\u0026rdquo; node. Change \u0026ldquo;Parameter Name\u0026rdquo; on the \u0026ldquo;Set Vector\u0026rdquo; large node from \u0026ldquo;None\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo;.\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t make up this name. Instead we took it from our parent material.\nThis image below is a reminder that if we go back to our parent material, inside of it we have a \u0026ldquo;Vector 4\u0026rdquo; parameter called \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo;.\nIn our material instance that we edit through the construction script, we can also see our \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo; parameter. In fact any of the \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameters\u0026rdquo; or the \u0026ldquo;Vector Parameters\u0026rdquo; seen in here, we could edit, if we wanted to.\nWe do that by using these two nodes.\nNote:\nFrom all of the descriptions and material vs construction script images you see above, you hopefully learned that we need to be careful and track exactly how we name our parameters inside of the material graph. We then use the names inside of our new blueprints, as exactly seen over in the material. If in your material you named your Base Tint to something different, then don\u0026#39;t copy that name from me, instead use the name you came up with back when you were making your material shader.\nNew Variable With all pins connected and with the \u0026ldquo;Parameter Name\u0026rdquo; of the \u0026ldquo;Set Vector\u0026rdquo; node put correctly, now lets create a new Blueprint Variable.\nClick on the (+) sign seen below to add a new variable.\nThe newly created variable, name \u0026ldquo;BaseColor\u0026rdquo;. You can do so by selecting the \u0026ldquo;NewVar\u0026rdquo; red boolean and then changing its name on the panel in the right hand side. From \u0026ldquo;Variable Type\u0026rdquo; over in that corner, search for \u0026ldquo;Linear Color\u0026rdquo; and set it to that. The red boolean indicator will turn into a dark blue Linear Color indicator. From the settings over there also turn on \u0026ldquo;Instance Editable\u0026rdquo;.\nInstance Editable turned on, in the settings there, is very important as that is what will let us change the color when we drag a blueprint instance in the open world.\nDrag \u0026ldquo;BaseColor\u0026rdquo; from the left side onto the board. From the context menu that shows and asks if you want to \u0026ldquo;Get\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Set\u0026rdquo; the Base Color, pick \u0026ldquo;Get. The node seen below will show up. Connect Base Color node pin into \u0026ldquo;Parameter Value\u0026rdquo; of \u0026ldquo;Set Vector Parameter Value on Material\u0026rdquo; node seen below. It will do a conversion for us (seen in the picture after the next one).\nEverything should look like above after the new conversion pin (the one going from dark blue to dark orange and then connecting into \u0026ldquo;Parameter Value\u0026rdquo;).\nTip:\nWhen we made our variable, instead of going for Linear Color we could have gone for Vector 3. That Vector 3 would have technically been a color - one with no alpha of course - that then directly connects above without needing a conversion node. When exposed, the Vector 3 would have X, Y and Z value and would not give us interface with a color picker, which is not ideal. Us using a Linear Color structure instead and then converting it to Vector 3 allows us to have a nice color picker which makes it more artist / user friendly. We will see that picker in action in a few pictures down this blog post.\nSelect the \u0026ldquo;BaseColor\u0026rdquo; from here (the left side panel) again. Click on the black box on the right side panel to change the default color. I put mine to blue. That color picked seen here would not have worked had we not done it the way the green \u0026ldquo;Tip\u0026rdquo; box above describes.\nWe are done with the Blueprint set up!\nIn A Level Drag our newly finished blueprint into the scene. It looks like this:\nNow duplicate the newly placed blue vortex blueprint. Move it to the side. From the right \u0026ldquo;Details\u0026rdquo; menu of UE5 change the color (this is the Base Color variable that we implemented).\nDuplicate your blueprint as many times. Set as many different colors you want. All of the materials are dynamic and are saved inside the level itself. As such our Project Directory is tidy and not overflowed with lots of material instances.\nColor Previews Here is one final view of our work.\nConclusion In this optional part of the VFX tutorial for creating a vortex basin, we looked at Blueprint set ups. We learned how to bundle our few different static meshes so they are more artist friendly and efficient to use. We then looked into using construction script in order to connect a linear color blueprint parameter into the material used on the vortex. That allowed us to efficiently change the color of each unique vortex blueprint instance, once put in the world, without having to make unique material instances in our project directory.\nI hope you enjoyed reading and going through this tutorial series. I had a lot of fun putting it together and I sincerely hope it comes to be useful and educational for anyone reading it out there.\nIt took me around a month and lots of hours after work to write this all up. It was a lot of effort to create all of the images, annotate them on top step by step, and give them alt text. I think we totalled to around 180 images. As such if you would like to drop a tip over at my Ko-fi page, I would be very grateful. You can find it in the blue badge link below. Alternatively you could purchase the asset itself from my shop.\nCheers,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.\nIf you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3. You can use any previous ones though, as already mentioned above.\nBefore we dive in, lets see the final preview of everything:\nVideos Preview (Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)\nSo far we\u0026rsquo;ve created the geometry, the textures and the moving, syphon-inwards material graph. Now we will create the refraction material to go on top.\n(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)\nScreenshots Preview Here are screenshot previews as well:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been mentioned in the previous entries but we are making only the VFX. We are not creating the rest of the room or the art seen. If you wish, you can read about the creation process of the rest of the room here.\nGet The Asset If you would like to buy the work files behind this tutorial series, follow the link by clicking the image below.\nRefraction Preview With the main visual already created - the circular vortex shader - we can now add another slice of detail to go on top. That will be in the shape of a refraction material that is mostly transparent. It will sit on a secondary copy of the base vortex basin static mesh. This copied static mesh will be moved slightly up in space so it floats.\nLooking at refraction is a bit hard in static screenshots. It\u0026rsquo;s an effect that is much more visible in movement. However, here is a screenshot where if you look closely in the upper right corner of the cylindrical basin of the green vortex, you can notice the refraction:\nThe refraction picks up colors from the rest of the scene. As such the warm gray color cells we see, above the green vortex, are not artifacts or transparent parts of the polar material. Instead its a refraction material put on a high value, picking up and refracting the rest of the scene.\nIt might look a bit odd, and perhaps ugly, from this close up, at this high value. I have put it to an intensity overly high just to showcase it. In our final result it will be much more subtle and work with the vortex in a much better way.\nHere is a video cut, as seen by the end of this tutorial, that shows the same watery refraction in a way more visible (pay attention to the lower and middle left corner of the circular basin, that is where you can see it the most).\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rVideo embedded above. Shows a clip of the b\u0026w vortex basin VFX. The refraction and all other elements are put together here. Material Graph Preview Before we get into creating the material graph, lets see all of it as a quick preview.\nNote:\nI have Pan U Refraction and Pan V Refraction scalars above. The ones going into the Panner node. I ended up not using those. You can either skip that part and have your TexCoord - Multiply - go directly into UVs of Normal Refraction, or you could follow and recreate it. I added them at first because I thought it might be useful to animate the refraction slightly in one direction. I ended up not using it. Perhaps you might want to try it and personalize your visual with it.\nCreating the Refraction Graph Navigate to the part of your Unreal Project Directory where you have a folder where you keep your Parent materials. Right click and create a new one. Name it \u0026ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction\u0026rdquo;. Open it.\nChange \u0026ldquo;Blend Mode\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Translucent\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;Shading Model\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Unlit\u0026rdquo;.\nTiling Refraction Right click and search for a \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameter\u0026rdquo; (or hold down \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard and press anywhere to instantly add one). Name it \u0026ldquo;Tiling Refraction\u0026rdquo;. Position it like below. Next search for \u0026ldquo;Texture Coordinates\u0026rdquo; and add one below the \u0026ldquo;Tiling Refraction\u0026rdquo;. Hold down \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard and then left mouse click anywhere on the screen to add a \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; node. Connect the A of it into \u0026ldquo;Tiling Refraction\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; into TexCoord[0].\nPanner (Optional) As mentioned in the yellow note box at the start of this article, this part for creating a moving panner is optional. You could skip it.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rdquo; and add it in here. Add two \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameters\u0026rdquo; and name them \u0026ldquo;Pan U Refraction\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Pan V Refraction\u0026rdquo;. After them add \u0026ldquo;AppendMany\u0026rdquo; node and Connect R and G of it as seen in the image below. (\u0026ldquo;Pan U Refraction\u0026rdquo; goes in \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Pan V Refraction\u0026rdquo; goes in \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo;)\nAdd a \u0026ldquo;Panner\u0026rdquo; connect each pin like seen below. Search for \u0026ldquo;TextureSampleParameter2D\u0026rdquo;. Name it \u0026ldquo;Normal Refraction\u0026rdquo;. From the settings set it to Normal.\nRefraction Amount and Lerp Important:\nWe said that the above Panner with its Time and two scalar parameters are optional. The TextureSampleParameter2D that we renamed to Normal Refraction is not optional (its mandatory). We need that even if we skip adding Panner. If you skipped it, revisit the previous image.\nAdd a new scalar parameter. Name it \u0026ldquo;Refraction Amount\u0026rdquo;. Search and add a \u0026ldquo;Linear Interpolate\u0026rdquo; from under \u0026ldquo;Maths\u0026rdquo; category. Connect \u0026ldquo;Refraction Amount\u0026rdquo; into the \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of the Lerp. In its \u0026ldquo;Alpha\u0026rdquo; connect the \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; chanel of the normal map (Normal Refraction).\nConnect all of it (the result of the Lerp) into the Refraction (IOR) in the final material input.\nFrame and Tidy Up Select all of the nodes below. Press \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; for \u0026ldquo;comment\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. Name the newly created frame \u0026ldquo;Refraction\u0026rdquo; and give it a blue color (or whatever color you like). Repositions your nodes inside so its more tidy.\nOpacity Final step.\nAdd a new \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameter\u0026rdquo; and name it \u0026ldquo;Opacity\u0026rdquo;. Connect it into the \u0026ldquo;Opacity\u0026rdquo; of the end material input. If you wish, frame it with a comment in red color.\nWe are all done with that.\nMaterial Instance Go back to your \u0026ldquo;Content Browser\u0026rdquo; and find your parent material that we just created. The \u0026ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction\u0026rdquo;. Right click on the asset and from the new context menu select one of the top options that reads \u0026ldquo;Create Material Instance\u0026rdquo;.\nRename the resulting instance from \u0026ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction_Inst\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A\u0026rdquo;\nUse the following settings (yours might appear in a different order because we didn\u0026rsquo;t group them, but that is okay):\nRefraction Amount: 0.76886\rPan U Refraction: 0\rPan V Refraction: 0\rTiling Refraction: 0.007108\rNormal Refraction (texture): crystal_surfaces_normal\rThe final one, the texture, is this one which you should have imported in your project already:\nBut if you don\u0026rsquo;t have it, then you can revisit the second tutorial of this series where we create the texture in Substance Designer. Find it over here \u0026ldquo;Part Two - Creating The Necessary Textures\u0026rdquo;.\nApplying The Material on a Mesh Lets go back in an open scene where we have placed the vortex mesh basin and the polar coordinates material on it, as seen in the previous tutorial step - \u0026ldquo;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader in UE5.\u0026rdquo;.\nIt should look like this (below). Im focusing on a version not tinted in blue, purple or green, but you can focus on whichever you like.\nDuplicate the mesh. Move the new copy a few millimeters up in Z direction (thats on the blue axis). It should float slightly above the old mesh seen below. It should all look a bit like the image below.\nChange the material of the floating mesh above to the \u0026ldquo;Refraction\u0026rdquo; material instance we just made (that is \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A\u0026rdquo;).\nAs a final step I went into Blender and made myself a hollow cylinder that is near the diameter of the vortex static mesh and protrudes outwards - that makes it a frame. I put that around my VFX to give it a finalized appearance and have it sit more like a hole or a well.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t cover the making of this cylinder because I trust you could make one yourself. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to go out of UE5 and into Maya or Blender, you could perhaps make your cylinder straight into UE5 using the Basic Brush geometry.\nTroubleshooting If you look straight from above, you will see that in the dead middle of the basin, there is UV distortion that breaks the visuals a bit.\nI could revisit the mesh and try to fix this in Blender, but I have a quicker and easier way that could potential look better.\nFrom the \u0026ldquo;Quickly Add To The Project\u0026rdquo; context menu, navigate to \u0026ldquo;Shapes\u0026rdquo; and then click on \u0026ldquo;Plane\u0026rdquo; to add one.\nPosition the newly added plane to the middle. It should sit just above the polar coordinates static mesh (so it hides the issue we have).\nWith the plane selected, change its material to the Polar Coordinates one.\nIf you wish, scale your plane up to personalize your visual by having the polar material on it be a bit larger that way. I personally left mine at xyz scale of 1,1,1 as it was seen in the previous step. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you. Just make sure if you scale it up to not have it go outside of the hollow cylinder, breaking the illusion and clipping outside.\nAll done! Congrats on following through with this tutorial.\nFinal Result Here is a video preview of our final result. Congrats.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rVideo embedded above. Shows a clip of the b\u0026w vortex basin VFX. The refraction and all other elements are put together here. Conclusion In this final step of the tutorial series we went over creating a refraction material graph shader. We then applied that on a mesh that sits a few millimeters above our previous static mesh basin, giving it a secondary level of detail.\nWith this tutorial we wrap up all visuals work on this. In the next, optional part, we will look over Blueprints functionality in UE5 / UE4 and how we can create an Actor that lets us change the color tint per instance basis, when used in the world.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve made yourself a VFX basin and picked a color tint you like, you can skip this next part. If you, however, wish to learn more about good practices with Blueprint Actors and how to use Construction Scripts in order to create more powerful set dressing actors, stick around for the next one.\nNext part in the tutorial - Improving the efficiency of our work through Blueprints and Constructions Scripts.\nCheers,\nPete.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

There are two other parts in this tutorial series. In \u0026ldquo;Part One\u0026rdquo; we created the base static geometry needed for the VFX. Then in \u0026ldquo;Part Two\u0026rdquo; we created some textured noises in Substance Designer.\nIn this third part, we will use the textures created inside an Unreal 5 Material Graph. First we will created the \u0026ldquo;parent\u0026rdquo; material, then we will copy an instance of it and tweak the values of the different scalars and parameters and get the visual that we see below.\nSoftware that we will be using:\nUnreal Engine 5 Blender Substance Designer Tip:\nIn this third part, I will be created the parent material in Unreal Engine 5. If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.\nIf you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3.

The technique we are after is UV distortion and tiling that with a panner makes a movement towards a central point. Like a vortex. This effect is accomplished through \u0026ldquo;polar coordinates\u0026rdquo;. It is all UV coordinates distortion. We feed in an ordinary tiling texture and we manipulate its UVs to get a circular, inwards motion (or outwards, we can change direction just through one parameter).\nA very simple, short explanation of what exactly we are doing is the following. We take linear direction coordinates: on the U and V axis and we use maths to distort them into circular coordinates.\nIf you would like to buy the work files behind this tutorial series, follow the link by clicking the image below.\nIn Other Games The above explained technique is incredibly powerful. It\u0026rsquo;s not hard to create and its not very demanding resources wise (it scales on the GPU, which is always a good thing for performance in games). As such its very commonly seen in games. That is both in old and new titles. Both in AAA and indie games.\nAs such I wanted to show you a few examples that I came across randomly, without searching, while I was playing some games recently. That will help you see the elegance of the technique we are about to use.\nDiablo IV In Diablo 4 that I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing quite a bit at the time of writing this, there are a few world bosses. The map gets a pin with a timer that gives you 30 minutes to get to a special zone where the boss entity will spawn. Lots of players gather there and if you are early you get to see a few different animations and effects that show the \u0026ldquo;preparation\u0026rdquo; of the spawning of the giant enemy you are about to face.\nWhen Ashava the Pestilent is about to spawn, their presence in Saraan Caldera is announced by this large, toothed mesh:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rVideo embedded above. Shows a clip from Diablo 4 that shows a flesh, bones and tooths-like giant 3D mesh. In the middle there is a flat plane with a vortex VFX motion that moves outwards, as if some miasma, tar and poison moves. If you look past the mesh and its movement, and focus on the middle, you will see a flat plane with a VFX material applied to it. That material is absolutely identical to the one we are making. Its a vortex like motion, panned outwards. The artist at Blizzard have made and applied normal and albedo textures to give it a dark, tar-like appearance. Looks amazing!\nBaldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3 Another title I\u0026rsquo;ve been obsessed with (many of you most likely are as well) is Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rAnother video embed above. Shows four adventurers inside the dark interiors of Moonrise Towers zone. Under their feet is an animated aura VFX. It looks like a bright, chroma and rainbow vortex. If you look under the feet of my Tiefling Sorcerer in the video above, on the dark floor tiles of Moonrise Towers you will see a bright, white vortex with outwards movement. From time to time it gets a chromatic tint that gives it a subtle rainbow look.\nThis again is exactly the polar coordinates UV distortion we are making. The difference between this one and ours (and the one in Diablo 4) is that here, the devs at Larian Studios have also put a low opacity mask. That gives the effect a more transparent look.\nMaterial Graph Preview Lets first see the entire material graph:\nThen lets zoom in for better readability:\nWith the output (final node) selected, here are its material settings to the left side of the screenshot:\nFor \u0026ldquo;Material Domain\u0026rdquo; we use \u0026ldquo;Surface. In the \u0026ldquo;Blend Mode\u0026rdquo; we go \u0026ldquo;Opaque\u0026rdquo;. For \u0026ldquo;Shading Model\u0026rdquo; we use \u0026ldquo;Unlit\u0026rdquo;. Two Sided is ticked off, Use Material Attributes is off as well. \u0026ldquo;Cast Ray Traced Shadows\u0026rdquo; is on and for Subsurface Profile there is nothing. The Advanced settings are left to their default states.\nIf you only want to get the visual result and are not interested in any technical, mathematical or further detailed explanation behind some of the steps and nodes, you can replicate what you see from the zoomed up pictures above and skip most of the tutorial below.\nLets start from the beginning though:\nCreating the Polar Coordinates Create a \u0026ldquo;Materials\u0026rdquo; folder in your project directory. Inside create a \u0026ldquo;Parents\u0026rdquo; folder. In there we will create our parent materials from which we will create our instanced materials later on.\nRight click in there and make a new material. Name it \u0026ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Vortex\u0026rdquo;. Open it. Click the output node and lets tweak the settings, putting them to what we mentioned tiny bit ago:\nRight click anywhere. In the search box that appears write \u0026ldquo;tex\u0026rdquo; and once \u0026ldquo;TextureCoordinates\u0026rdquo; appears, click on it to add it.\nHold \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. Press once on the board, under the newly added TexCoord node. A new \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameter\u0026rdquo; will appear. It will have its name set as \u0026ldquo;Param\u0026rdquo;. Edit it and name it \u0026ldquo;Polar Centre\u0026rdquo;.\nComponent Mask Using the search we explained, find and add \u0026ldquo;Subtract\u0026rdquo; node. Connect it like what is seen below. Then search \u0026ldquo;ComponentMask\u0026rdquo; and add two of them. We will order and tweak them in the next step.\nSelect the \u0026ldquo;ComponentMask\u0026rdquo; node. By default \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; channels are on. For node that is on the top row, leave only \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; on. For the node that is at the bottom, leave \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; on. Then search for a \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; node. Add it like seen below (which is both A and B connected to the Subtract).\nArctangent2 Search for \u0026ldquo;Arctangent2\u0026rdquo; and add one. Connect the two masks into it.\nTip:\nArc tangent is an inverse tangent function. We do an inverse tangent function because we are switching from Cartesian coordinates and moving into Polar coordinates. We are doing Arctangent2 instead of Arctangent because we are dealing with a coordinates system split into four quadrants. Arctangent would limit us only into quadrant number one and four. By the end of this tutorial I\u0026#39;ve linked further reading on the topic.\n(If you would like a bit more optimized result, you can replace your Arctangent2 for Arctangent2Fast. It is a node a bit less accurate, but still accurate enough for our visuals to remain the same.)\nPi Add a \u0026ldquo;Component Mask\u0026rdquo; again, this time change its settings so only \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; channel is on. After it add a \u0026ldquo;Divide\u0026rdquo; node and connect the Mask into A. Then search for \u0026ldquo;math pi\u0026rdquo; and select Pi to add on the board.\nAdd a Scalar Parameter with a value of 2 and connect it into Multiplier (S) input of the Pi node. Connect the Pi output into the B input of Divide node.\nTip:\nLet\u0026#39;s say you are recreating this in Unity in Shader Graph or in Amplify Shader Editor. Because you totally could, all nodes and functions exist over there, no matter it is another engine. If for some reason Pi is not defined in whatever package you have, you could just add a new scalar parameter and give it a value of == 6.2831 which would be correct enough approximation of 2 x Pi for the shader to work well.\nFrac After the \u0026ldquo;Divide\u0026rdquo; node, add a \u0026ldquo;Frac\u0026rdquo; node. Now take a look at the lower row, right after the \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; node. Create a Mask (R) and Mask (G) nodes. Connect both of them into an \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; node.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;SquareRoot\u0026rdquo;. Add it into the board (it will show up as \u0026ldquo;Sqrt\u0026rdquo;). Now put two \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; nodes at each row and connect into \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; of each.\nAdd two \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; nodes and connect them into \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of each \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo;. In the \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of the multipliers, add new Scalar Parameters. Name them \u0026ldquo;Polar Speed\u0026rdquo; for top row and \u0026ldquo;Polar Diagonal Speed\u0026rdquo; for bottom row.\nTime Search for \u0026ldquo;Time\u0026rdquo; node and add it. Connect it into both \u0026ldquo;A\u0026quot;s of each \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; node (as seen in picture below).\nAdd two \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; nodes. The previous \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; node seen on top row, connect into A of Multiply top. The bottom \u0026ldquo;Add\u0026rdquo; node, connect to \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of the new, secondary \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; on that row.\nAdd two new Scalar Parameters. Top one call \u0026ldquo;Tile U\u0026rdquo; and connect to \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of top row Multiply. Bottom one call \u0026ldquo;Tile V\u0026rdquo; and connect to the \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; of bottom row Multiply.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;AppendVector\u0026rdquo; from under \u0026ldquo;Math\u0026rdquo; category. Add it to the board. Connect each row as seen here.\nTip for a tidy board:\nYou can select all of the nodes and press \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard (C stands for Comment in this case). That will add a big frame over it all. For text put in \u0026ldquo;Polar Coordinates\u0026rdquo;. Change the color to blue or whatever you like.\nFocus on the right side of the previous work, right after the \u0026ldquo;Append\u0026rdquo;.\nSearch \u0026ldquo;Texture Sample\u0026rdquo;. Add one and connect \u0026ldquo;Append\u0026rdquo; into its \u0026ldquo;UVs\u0026rdquo; pin. With the \u0026ldquo;Texture Sample\u0026rdquo; selected, rename it to \u0026ldquo;AlbedoTexture\u0026rdquo;. In its settings change the following: MipValueMode: MipLevel (absolute, 0 is full resolution). Sampler Type: Linear Color. (these are pointed in the image below).\nColor Control Lets create the final part of the shader. It will be a bunch of new nodes that we will then frame into a red comment box, as seen below.\nStart by adding a \u0026ldquo;Vector Parameter\u0026rdquo;. Name it \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo;. Connect it to a new Multiply. Then add a new \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameter\u0026rdquo;. Name it \u0026ldquo;Tint Power\u0026rdquo;. Connect it to the Multiply as well.\nAdd another \u0026ldquo;Scalar Parameter\u0026rdquo;. Name it \u0026ldquo;Brightness\u0026rdquo;. Connect it to the \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; of a new Multiply node. In the A connect the AlbedoTexture node from the previous steps.\nAdd a final \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo;. In the A input of it, add the previous \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo;. In the B, add the \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo; that comes right after the \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo; color node (vector parameter). The result of this final \u0026ldquo;Multiply\u0026rdquo;, connect into the \u0026ldquo;Emissive Color\u0026rdquo; of the final Material Input.\n(When you are done with all of the above you can select it all and add yourself a red comment frame, like seen below. Name it \u0026ldquo;Color Control\u0026rdquo;.)\nWe are all done! Zoom out and take a look at all of it.\nMaterial Instance Go back to your Project Directory. Find where this material parent that we just made is. Right click on it and select \u0026ldquo;Create Material Instance\u0026rdquo;. Call it \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Open it. All of the Scalar Parameters and Vector Parameters (color) have default values but we now want to connect our texture in there and also change the values so we get the visual we want.\nParameters After opening the newly created material instance, use the parameter values as seen here:\nTint Power: 1.3\nBrightness: 0.8\nPolar Centre: 0.5\nPolar Diagonal Speed: 0.025\nPolar Speed: 0.02\nTile U: 1.0\nTile V: 3.5\nAlbedo Texture: TEX_Liquid_Albedo (this is the black and white texture we made in the previous tutorial)\nBase Tint: FFFFFF00 (white color)\nPreview in Action Drag into a scene the imported vortex geometry you created in part one of the tutorial. Then change its scale to 1.5 1.5 1.3 (this is optional, I just scaled mine a bit so its not too small when compared to a 2m tall human mannequin).\nThen change the material settings. Select the Material Instance we created - \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”.\nCongrats! This is it. You should be able to see the movement and animation in the VFX.\nTroubleshooting If you dragged your material shader onto the geometry and your object suddenly turned pitch black, then lets fix that.\nThis most commonly happens on older versions of UE.5. Its due to the material graph parent shader not being suitable for \u0026ldquo;Nanite Geometry\u0026rdquo;.\nRemove the imported static geometry vortex basin from the project directory (content browser). Now re-import it but this time around from the Import settings tick \u0026ldquo;Nanite\u0026rdquo; off. Now retry dragging it into the scene and applying the material and it should work.\nImportant:\nIf you look at the VFX result from a camera angle from above, you will see UV distortion imperfection. We resolve that in the next part of the tutorial. Even if you don\u0026#39;t want to create a refraction shader, and would like to skip that, make sure to still visit the next tutorial and find the solution to this UV distortion issue.\nNext part in the tutorial where we can see the solution to fixing the UV distortion in the middle. Scroll down to the \u0026ldquo;Troubleshooting\u0026rdquo; chapter in there to see it.\nColor We keep it to white here because in the final part of the tutorial series, we will create a Blueprint in which we control the color tint. That part is optional. As such if you prefer to skip it, and instead want the colors right away, as seen in the tutorial previews (blue, purple, green), then do the following.\nCreate 3 copies of the above material instance. That is the one we just made and called \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Those copies rename \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Blue”, \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Purple” and \u0026ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Green”. Go in each and change the \u0026ldquo;Base Tint\u0026rdquo; HEX linear value.\nBlue: 1A5CF700\nPurple: 941AF700\nGreen: 1AF78100\nConclusion In this tutorial we created the main driving force of the VFX: the polar coordinates shader. We then created material instances of it and went over what settings to use in order to get the visual we want.\nIn the next part of the series, we will quickly create a \u0026ldquo;Refraction\u0026rdquo; material shader. We will use that as a floating layer of detail, above the vortex we have now. This step will be incredibly short and easy to make in comparison to the length and difficulty of the previous 3 parts of this tutorial.\nNext part in the tutorial - Creating Refraction Material Graph. Adding it as a layer of detail on the vortex.\nBibliography Arctan - Math Open Reference\nAnimating UV Coordinates - Unreal Engine Documentation\nMath Material Expressions - Unreal Engine Documentation\nPolar and Cartesian Coordinates\u0026hellip; and how to convert between them.\nPolar Coordinates Node Description - Unity Documentation\nCheers,\nPete.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

In \u0026ldquo;Part One\u0026rdquo; we already went over how to create the geometry needed for the VFX.\nIn this \u0026ldquo;Part Two\u0026rdquo; blog entry, we will go over how to create some quick textured noises in Substance Designer. Those textures are one of the driving forces in the VFX effect.\nSoftware that we will be using:\nUnreal Engine 5 Blender Substance Designer Tip:\nI will be using Substance 3D Designer 2021. The nodes I use are widely available in older versions of the software too, so you should be able to follow along without an issue.\nBefore we dive into the Substance work, lets take a look at a reminder of what we are creating.\nVideos Preview (Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)\nAs mentioned in the previous tutorial part, the textures and shaders we create will allows us to derive many colored versions of the VFX:\n(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)\nScreenshots Preview As seen before, here are screenshot previews:\nWe are making only the VFX, not the rest of the room or art, but you can read about the creation process of those over here..\nTextures Preview Here is what we will create in this tutorial:\nWe need two textures:\n1 - Main \u0026ldquo;Liquid Noise\u0026rdquo; Texture;\n2 - Normal \u0026ldquo;Crystal Matrix\u0026rdquo; Texture;\nThose are all very short and quick Substance Designer graphs. Some of the noises, like the crystal normals we then will reuse twice in the refraction shader for the VFX. My process when making VFX or any general 3D scenes most of the times includes creating \u0026ldquo;common\u0026rdquo; type of noises - both b\u0026amp;w and normal map ones - and then reusing them across assets. That\u0026rsquo;s what I did here too.\nIn fact I created the textures you see above for the normal tiling details and texture work on the center piece, giant crystal cluster prop in the scene over here: \u0026ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt.\u0026rdquo; I liked how they turned out and believed I could reuse them in a VFX.\nStep One - Albedo (Main Mask) Lets first create the liquid-spill, black and purple \u0026ldquo;albedo\u0026rdquo; texture. We will make a desaturated, black and white one first but then with a few quick edits in the UE5 shader for the VFX we will derive other colored variants in our Material Graph and Blueprint set up.\nAs you can see the visual here is powerful but quite simple, accomplished just by the use of 7 nodes. Lets go over them one by one.\nMoisture Noise Create a blank 4k graph.\nSearch for a \u0026ldquo;Moisture Noise\u0026rdquo; and drag a copy into the graph. Select the node (the Moisture Noise one) and edit its Instance Parameters to the following: Scale: 1, Disorder: 0.21, Pattern Size X: 2 Pattern Size Y: 0.68, Pattern Angle: Turns: 0.505 and Degrees 181.8, Pattern Angle Random: 0.01, Global Opacity 1.79.\nPlasma + Slope Blur Under the Moisture Noise node, add a Plasma node. Edit its instance parameters to the following: Scale: 0 and Disorder: 0.53.\nNow lets add a \u0026ldquo;Slope Blur Grayscale\u0026rdquo; node. Search for that and plop it to the right of the existing two nodes. Make sure you drag in a \u0026ldquo;Grayscale\u0026rdquo; one and not a \u0026ldquo;Color\u0026rdquo; one.\nTip:\nWe are currently defining our main shapes, noises and motives. We best do that in black and white as its easier to manipulate the nodes in that mode. Later on, once we like the shapes and patterns we have, we will introduce color. This is the reason we are currently using Grayscale nodes as opposed to Color ones. In general, in most art mediums, its easier to approach things step by step, starting black and white and then later moving to color.\nNext, lets simplify all we have and lose some of the fine details and gradient-like blurs.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;Quantize\u0026rdquo;. Select a grayscale one. Add it to the right of the Slope Blur. For its instance parameters use \u0026ldquo;Quantize: 5\u0026rdquo;.\nWith the Quantize in, everything is more simple. But we don\u0026rsquo;t want to leave it looking pixelated and harsh.\nAdd a \u0026ldquo;Blur HQ\u0026rdquo; node and connect it to the Quantize node. Click to edit its settings and use the following. Intensity: 0.57 and Quality: 1.\nAdding Color Gradient We have the main motives in. Now lets give them a grayscale color gradient. Search for \u0026ldquo;Gradient Map\u0026rdquo; and drag a copy of that node. Connect it to our previous node. In its settings put Color Mode: Grayscale. Then click the button called \u0026ldquo;Gradient Editor\u0026rdquo; under the \u0026ldquo;Color Mode\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Gradient Addressing\u0026rdquo; options in order to open the Gradient Ramp expanded window (where you select colors).\nYou want to hand place color pins, similar to what you see here:\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to entirely match it. In fact, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be precise at all. If you like my shade grayscale colors and the result, then copy the gray color seen above (its hex code is #a3a3a3). Then start hand placing similar pins left and right. You can expand the Gradient Editor window by dragging its right corner. That way you can see better.\nHere is min expanded, hopefully you can match yours to it better that way:\nI encourage you to experiment and give your own touch and vision to this step. Use my placement of gray pins if you want identical effect. If not, try your own but just try to have a good amount of darkness spots, as in above, as that is what keeps the VFX easier to read, stylish and mysterious. Also keep it black and white because we will tint it in color in UE5.\nNext lets add \u0026ldquo;Levels\u0026rdquo; node.\nSearch \u0026ldquo;Levels\u0026rdquo; and put one right after the Gradient Map node. In its settings (its Specific Parameters), there is a Levels Histogram. It looks like a large mostly white (gray) square. On each corner it has a thumb. Move the upper, right corner, white thumb inwards. Move it to about the position seen in the image below.\nLets quickly blur HQ once again though. That will make sure we don\u0026rsquo;t have any overly sharp areas. In the world of textures, sharpness is good, but when its too much it gives artificial, low-quality look to things. As such we want to avoid that.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;Blur HQ Color\u0026rdquo;. Add it and for its settings use: Intensity: 0.1 and Quality: 1.\nOutput Node Once you are done, add an \u0026ldquo;Output\u0026rdquo; node. That together with proper compression settings will let you export your texture.\nFor the settings of the Output node, use these:\nIdentifier: whatever name you want. Mine happens to be \u0026ldquo;TEX_Liquid_Albedo\u0026rdquo; but yours might be \u0026ldquo;output\u0026rdquo; which is fine. You might want to name it similar to mine as it will be easier to identify later on.\nDescription: empty\nLabel: Base Color\nUser Data: empty\nGroup: Material\nFormat: Default Format. Mipmaps: Full pyramid\nThe above ones are mostly used for visualization in Substance Designer. As such they are not overly important but you might want to match them to mine nonetheless. Then come the important ones which will dictate how the bitmap looks and behaves after export. Those are:\nUsage: Components: RGB with usage \u0026ldquo;mask\u0026rdquo; and Color Space put to Linear.\nWith the settings put to what is needed, now right click your graph name under the *.sbs work file you have open. This is in the upper left corner of the screen, where it says EXPLORER. From the context menu that shows up with right click, select \u0026ldquo;Export outputs as bitmaps\u0026rdquo;. In the screen that pops up, make sure your \u0026ldquo;TEX_Liquid_Albedo\u0026rdquo; is selected, pick an export destination and hit \u0026ldquo;Export outputs\u0026rdquo;.\nStep Two - Normal \u0026ldquo;Crystal Matrix\u0026rdquo; Texture Now, lets create the normal map that we will use in the refraction shader that gives a secondary level of detail and visual interest to our VFX basin.\nThis one is a relatively quick node graph as well. If the previous one we did was 7 nodes, then this one is 10 nodes (without taking the output in this total sum).\nCrystal 1 \u0026amp; Crystal 2 Let\u0026rsquo;s begin by searching for \u0026ldquo;Crystal\u0026rdquo;. Two nodes will show up. We want both. Drag the \u0026ldquo;Crystal 1\u0026rdquo; node on the top in the graph. Under it, place a \u0026ldquo;Crystal 2\u0026rdquo; node. Then take a note of the settings to the right for each, displayed in the image below:\n(Settings for Crystal 1 - black one - Scale: 55, Disorder: 0.19)\n(Settings for Crystal 2 - white one - Scale: 1, Disorder: 0)\nFrom the right of Crystal 2 (bright one) lets add a \u0026ldquo;Histogram Scan\u0026rdquo;. Search and drag a copy of that. Connect it as seen below. Then double click it and for settings put the following: Position: 0.31 and Contrast: 0. Invert Position: False.\nBlur HQ Let\u0026rsquo;s add a Blur HQ Grayscale next. Search for that and drag one of it, connecting it in the second row (where Crystal 2 is). For settings use Intensity: 1.14 and Quality: 1.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. Drag one and connect top row \u0026ldquo;Crystal 1\u0026rdquo; to the top pin of \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. Then connect the bottom, last node from the \u0026ldquo;Crystal 2\u0026rdquo; row to the third input pin of \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. As illustrated below.\nWe use the default settings for \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. Only make sure the connections are like what you see here.\nSearch for \u0026ldquo;Levels\u0026rdquo;. Add one to the board. Connect it to the \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo; node from the previous step. Select it and in the settings of it, move the upper middle thumb and the lower right corner thumb inwards. Push them to the positions seen in the image below.\nHistogram Scan Search for a \u0026ldquo;Histogram Scan\u0026rdquo; node. Add it as seen in the image below. For \u0026ldquo;Instance Parameters\u0026rdquo; (its settings), use Position: 0.34 and Contrast: 0.\nLets once more blend. Search for a \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. Drag one and connect top row node to the top pin of \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo;. Then in the second pin, connect the node from the previous step we took. For settings for \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo; use the following: Opacity: 0.21 and Blending Mode: Add (Linear Dodge).\nSearch for a \u0026ldquo;Blur HQ\u0026rdquo;. Put a \u0026ldquo;Grayscale\u0026rdquo; one to the board. Connect it to the \u0026ldquo;Blend\u0026rdquo; node from the last step. For settings use: Intensity: 0.14 and Quality: 1.\nNormal Conversion We want to turn this black and white texture into a normal texture now. Search for \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo;. Pick the one seen below as an icon (if you are on an older version of Substance Designer, your icon might be different. Try to find a node that takes any input and turns it into Normal). In the settings of \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; node manually click the number of the \u0026ldquo;Intensity\u0026rdquo;. That will let you type 8 as a value. If you just drag the slider, you might reach an upper limit of 3. We can go over it by clicking on the number 3 itself and putting whatever we want through our keyboard.\nOutput Node Search for \u0026ldquo;Output\u0026rdquo; and add it after the \u0026ldquo;Normal\u0026rdquo; node from last step. Name it accordingly. I named my \u0026ldquo;TEX_Crystal_Matrix\u0026rdquo;. For the other settings do the following:\nDescription: empty\nLabel: Normal\nUser Data: empty\nGroup: Material\nFormat: Default Format. Mipmaps: Full pyramid\nUsage: Components: RGBA with usage \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; and Color Space left blank.\nNote:\nIn your Substance Designer little window that gives you a preview of your texture, your normal map end result might look overly noisy and pixelated. A bit glitchy, like what I have in the image above. After you export it, using the next step, you can open up your final image and you will see that it does not look that overly noisy and glitchy. It will still have stepping lines, lots of them, but they will appear much better.\nLets export to a bitmap (an image). Right click the name of your graph. You can find that under the name of your current *.sbs file, in upper left corner of Designer. Hit \u0026ldquo;Export outputs as bitmaps\u0026rdquo;. From the window that appears, make sure your newly created normal texture output is selected. Pick a location to export it to and hit export.\nTip:\nIn this tutorial I exported a few of my textures as a *.PNG format. However, most of the time in my personal projects I save out as a *.TGA instead (Truevision Targa). Over at work at Rebellion, I save and use exclusively only *.TGA as well. That is pretty much the common standard used in the games industry.\nIn general, *.TGA is a very high quality file format. This is incredibly beneficial for texture types like normal maps, where lossy compression, for example *.JPG is detrimental. *.PNG is lossless, yet as mentioned above, in most game studios, *.TGA is the standard.\nConclusion We are done and have created two textures and exported them. One is a black and white mask that we use like an \u0026ldquo;albedo\u0026rdquo; but tint in a color later in Unreal 5. The second one is a normal map \u0026ldquo;matrix\u0026rdquo; noise that we will use in a refraction shader.\nImport your textures to your Unreal project. Your normal map will get picked up automatic by the engine as being a normal map, and will get its settings changed to the correct ones.\nHowever, your black and white, \u0026ldquo;liquid\u0026rdquo; mask, after import, you want to double click and open in Unreal.\nWith the textures created and all imported, in the next entry of this tutorial we will create the \u0026ldquo;Polar Coordinates\u0026rdquo; main Material Graph that will support our VFX. We will use the textures in there.\nThen we will create a second, smaller material shader. That one will be a refraction one and will be an additional layer of detail, to sit above our liquid spill vortex.\nNext part of the tutorial: \u0026ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 07 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Three\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you would like to buy the work files behind this tutorial series, follow the link by clicking the image below.\nCheers,\nPete.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

Instead of an overview and writing about my creative process, this one is a step-by-step guide. It is a written tutorial about how to create an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. It also will go over how to create geometry needed by the VFX idea and how to create some quick textured noises in Substance Designer. The textures are one of the driving forces in the VFX.\nSoftware that we will be using:\nUnreal Engine 5 Blender Substance Designer Tip:\nIf you prefer Maya or 3Ds Max over Blender, then you could replicate the steps I take in your modelling package of choice and create the mesh we will need.\nWe will use Unreal Engine 5. However, we will not use any new or locked to UE5 features. If you are working in Unreal Engine 4, you could easily follow and replicate anything you see here.\nWithout further ado, lets dive in.\nVideos Preview Before getting into the steps of creating the VFX, lets take a look at a quick preview. It will show us what we are about to create.\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)\nThe material shader we will create will allow us to reuse every piece we\u0026rsquo;ve made and derive different colors:\n(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)\nScreenshots Preview Here are some screenshot previews, showing the VFX in static images.\nThis tutorial will cover how to create only the vortex itself. It will not look at how to make the sculpture, stone basin that the VFX sits in. It will also not look at the making of any other art elements seen above.\nIf you are curious how the environment room was created and then how the crystals shaped to existence, you can do so by reading my previous entries in the blog series. You can do so over here.\nIf you like the VFX and you are not here for learning, but instead would wish to purchase the UE5 assets, follow the link by clicking the image below.\nPieces Necessary The necessary pieces we will need and see how to create in this tutorial are:\n1x Static mesh - this is a torus shaped into a basin. 1x \u0026ldquo;Polar Coordinates\u0026rdquo; material shader - this is the black and blue material that pans inwards, creating a \u0026ldquo;vortex\u0026rdquo; effect. 1x Refraction material shader - material using a tiled normal map that refracts light and sits on top of the main vortex as a secondary slice of detail. 3x Texture noises. One for masking things (linear, black and white). Another for the black and blue liquid visual (this acts bit like an albedo). Then a final normal map that has crystal-like distortions and when tiled the correct amount gives the refraction shader its appearance. Lets begin with first creating the Static Meshes needed for the VFX.\nBase Shape Before we dive into any detailed steps about how to create the geometry, lets first see the final result:\nIn the following guide we will recreate the geo seen above.\nThe vortex basin above has two key metrics: its wide 2 meters and its tall around 0.75 meters. As it goes downwards in space, its diameter of 2 meters shrinks to 1.5 meter then to 1.2 m then to a final 0.15 meters. The numbers above in the image have floating points but you can stick to the round numbers mentioned just now. The mesh is UV mapped without any seams (planar top-view mapping). Any slight distortion in the islands due to that will not be a problem and will instead help our VFX final result.\n(You can inspect the UVs in step 5.13, seen right by the end of this page.)\nIf you are an intermediate to advanced 3D modeller, don\u0026#39;t feel obliged to follow the next steps. By looking at the wireframe mesh above, you could recreate a similar results of your own, however you wish. For the VFX basin to look like the final results you don\u0026#39;t need to constrain yourself to a carbon copy geometry. You could put your own touch of tweaks and personalizations on your geometry and still get an awesome result. If that is the case, skip through all of the Blender steps below.\nAs mentioned above, if you wish to skip the geometry guide, and have created something of your own, head to this link \u0026ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two\u0026rdquo; for the next part in this VFX tutorial series.\nStep One Start by opening a new Blender scene and pressing SHIFT + A to create a new primitive shape. From the drop-down menu, pick a Cylinder:\nAfter adding a cylinder, in the lower, left corner of the screen we will get options to pick the features of the cylinder primitive:\nStep Two If a large context menu for \u0026ldquo;Add Cylinder\u0026rdquo; like above doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately show for you, then make sure to look for a small bar menu going by the same name, hidden in that same lower left corner. Clicking on it will expand you the settings seen in the image above.\nMost of the settings we can ignore. The important ones are \u0026ldquo;Vertices: 32\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Radius: 1 m\u0026rdquo;.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Depth 1 m\u0026rdquo; is not particularly important because in the next step we will actually remove any edge loops that make up the outer ring faces of the cylinder. As such its depth will be removed.\nStep Three Next, press anywhere on the cylinder with the left mouse button. Then hit TAB on your keyboard to go into \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo; (or perhaps you have yours set to ALT+E as a shortcut.)\nThe goal here is to switch from \u0026ldquo;Object Mode\u0026rdquo; and go into \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;. If neither TAB or ALT+E work for you, then try with the contextual radial menu seen and described in the picture above.\nStep Four Once you are in \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;, select all faces, everywhere, while keeping only the very top circle face deselected.\nAs the image above describes, press \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard to select all faces. Then hold down Shift on keyboard and left mouse button click on the circle at the top to deselect it.\nNext press \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. It will open the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; contextual menu. From that dropdown menu select \u0026ldquo;Faces\u0026rdquo; to delete.\nThere are lots of ways to select the faces whilst only leaving the top circle deselected. Do whichever way you like and don\u0026#39;t feel obliged to follow the description above as to how to accomplish it. If you wish, select each face one by one with the mouse whilst holding shift. Or instead select by big face loops, by holding ALT and clicking on the outer edge of a face, the edge facing the direction you want to mass select a loop.\nStep Five Now that you have deleted all of the outer wall faces and the bottom face, we are left only with the top circle face.\nSelect it. Then press \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Inset Faces\u0026rdquo;. Click anywhere on the screen to have the lower left corner contextual menu for \u0026ldquo;Inset\u0026rdquo; appear (seen and described in the image below).\nFrom the \u0026ldquo;Inset Faces\u0026rdquo; menu, select a Thickness of 0.15 m.\nNext, select the circle in the middle and press \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Delete Face\u0026rdquo; and be left with an outer ring like this:\nStep Six Select the inside loop of edges (marked in orange below). Move them down in Z direction to get this:\nAs mentioned above, press \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. That will start a \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; command. If you follow up immediately by pressing \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; you will lock the movement onto that axis. Move the mouse slightly down. Then press anywhere on the screen in order to get the \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; contextual menu show up. In that put in -0.07 m as a setting for Z.\nWith that same edge loop selected, press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale down. Move the mouse to do any amount, then let go (press left mouse button). Once the Resize (scale) context menu shows up, put in X,Y and Z an uniform number: 0.896.\nAs described in the image above, use \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; to move the edge loop again. This time around move it down in Z by -0.075m.\nImage above: Press \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Extrude\u0026rdquo;. Immediately press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Scale\u0026rdquo; Move the mouse out and click on the screen again. In the lower left corner context menu, put in 1.261 in X, Y and Z axis.\nImage above: Press \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; to move. Immediately press \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock on that axis. Move the mouse down and click anywhere. In the context menu that shows up, put -0.038 in Z axis.\nStep Seven Rotate your camera slightly down so you see the mesh from the side. Press \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Extrude\u0026rdquo;. Immediately press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to Scale down the newly made extrusion.\nIn the context menu that will show up, use uniform 0.806 as a scale down factor.\nImage below: Now move the edge loop down by -0.075 m in Z axis. As mentioned, keep X and Y 0, for Z put -0.075 m.\nPress \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to extrude. Immediately press \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; to move followed by pressing \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock on that axis. Move down the mouse, click anywhere. Put in 0.033 m in the context menu, as seen in image below.\nWith the above image \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo; complete, now press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale. We want to push the loop a bit inwards. To accomplish that, scale uniformly by 0.932 on all axis. Seen in the image below.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s extrude a new loop of faces: Press \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to extrude. Then immediately press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale. When the menu shows up, scale on every axis uniformly by 1.196 points (as seen in image below).\nWe want to extrude again: Press \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo;. Follow up immediately by pressing \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo;. Then press \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock the movement onto that axis. Drag the mouse downwards on the screen. In the menu that pops up, put -0.18 m in the Z.\nI keep repeating the hotkeys for common actions like Move, Extrude, Scale and how they work with keyboard and mouse clicks and movements. I do that so this tutorial is friendly to any Blender users, especially those who might be beginners. However if you are an advanced user, feel free to skim through most of the texts here and extract only the important info of by how much and in what axis to extrude, move, scale, rotate.\nStep Eight Rotate your camera slightly below the mesh so you can see better. Make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve selected the orange edge loop seen below. Press \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; then drag the mouse and click. When the context menu shows up, put 0.448 points in each axis uniformly.\nNow lets move that selecting upwards in space. The face loop we just created in the last step, we now want to move up by A LOT. Press \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; and move mouse up. After clicking anywhere, menu shows up. Put 0.471 m in the field for Z.\nLets rotate our camera on the upside again. In the picture below we don\u0026rsquo;t do any new actions. Instead we look at how your mesh should look so far, when looked from the above angle.\nI mention this in a step later on, but: if your mesh so far looks roughly similar, but is not identical, and has some differences, don\u0026#39;t worry about it. This VFX relies on creating a --vortex basin-- but the rules for making that are not set in stone. You can have slight differences, or some of your loops might be slightly misplaced up or down, compared to mine in the pics above. That doesn\u0026#39;t mean that your VFX won\u0026#39;t turn out just fine. It will look good.\nPress \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; and move cursor down. We are now moving the newly extruded loop down. In the Z put -0.6 m. Seen below:\nLets rotate the camera to look from below once again. Then press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale. Scale down uniformly on all axis by 0.356 points. This will give you the result like in the image below.\nPress \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to extrude, then \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; immediately to scale down. On every axis, scale down by 0.702 points. That gets us the little ring seen in the image below, that is sitting slightly flat.\nStep Nine Lets move the loop from last step down in space. Press \u0026ldquo;G\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Move\u0026rdquo;. Then \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock on that axis. In the Move settings in context menu, put in minus 0.095 m for Z.\nNext, rotate your camera to look at the mesh from above (so you can see it in a similar way to the image below). In this image we don\u0026rsquo;t do any actions. We just want to start looking at the mesh from this angle.\nSelect the edge loop marked in orange in the image below. Then lets twist it. Press \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Rotate\u0026rdquo; the selection, then \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock on that axis. Click with the mouse anywhere. In the menu that shows up, put 12 degrees. (if you put say minus 12, it will also work. Any angle works really, as long as its not a crazy big angle.)\nMove your camera so you see the mesh a bit more from the side. Select the orange loop seen below. Lets twist that one too. When it\u0026rsquo;s selected, press \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Rotate\u0026rdquo; then \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock onto that rot axis. For an angle put 26.3 degrees.\nLook at the mesh slightly from above again. Select the orange loop seen below. Twist it. Put a rotation angle of 17.7 degrees.\nSelect the top loop, seen in orange in the image below. Twist this one too. For an angle put minus 46 degrees.\nLook at the mesh from below / slight profile view again. Select the loop in orange below. This this one too. Reminder: to twist use \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo; to rotate, \u0026ldquo;Z\u0026rdquo; to lock onto that axis. Then press on the screen. In the context menu put an angle of 24.9 degrees.\nRotate to look at the mesh from above. In this picture we don\u0026rsquo;t do any actions. Your mesh should look similar to above. If there are slight, very small differences, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. The VFX will still look awesome.\nGo out of \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo; and back to \u0026ldquo;Object Mode\u0026rdquo; (reminder - for me, I do that by pressing TAB on the keyboard. You might have a different keybinding though.) Select your mesh - either by clicking on it or using the Collection Manager. Look at the right hand menus. Click on the \u0026ldquo;Modifiers\u0026rdquo; tab (its icon is in blue color and looks like a wrench). To the right of it then click \u0026ldquo;Add Modifier\u0026rdquo;. From the menu that shows up in picture after the next one, select \u0026ldquo;Subdivision Surface\u0026rdquo; as a modifier.\nFor Modifier, as mentioned before, select \u0026ldquo;Subdivision Surface\u0026rdquo;.\nYour modifier settings should use the following: Catmull-Clark as algorithm type. Level Viewport: 2.\nYour geometry is subdivided and smooth now, but your normals are faceted. Lets smooth them out. Right click with mouse button anywhere on top of the mesh. From the \u0026ldquo;Object Context Menu\u0026rdquo; that shows up click to select \u0026ldquo;Shade Smooth\u0026rdquo;.\nStep Ten Go back to \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;. You will see wireframe overlaid on top of the subdivided geometry. If you don\u0026rsquo;t, then make sure your settings here are identical as seen in the image below (step 39 is skipped due to numerical error, there are no images missing through).\nSelect the edge loop seen in orange below.\nWith that selection made, press \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale and then move the mouse inwards on the screen. Press anywhere. On the context menu that shows up, put uniform scale of 0.866 points in every axis.\nLets go back to \u0026ldquo;Object Mode\u0026rdquo;. Select the mesh and in the right menu click on the blue arrow (seen in the screenshot below marked as number 1) then press on \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; (marked as number 2).\nAfter we\u0026rsquo;ve applied the modifier, lets go back to \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;. The mesh should look like below (if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t then most likely you\u0026rsquo;ve not applied the modifier yet. As such revisit the previous step.).\nStart selecting every second loop (hold ALT on the keyboard and then left mouse click on one edge and it will select the entire length of it). You can start selecting every second loop from wherever you like on the mesh. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to start from the spot I have started from in the image.\nStep Eleven When you have selected every second loop, your selection should look like in the image below:\nPress \u0026ldquo;X\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. This brings the \u0026ldquo;Delete\u0026rdquo; contextual menu. From that menu select \u0026ldquo;Dissolve Edges\u0026rdquo;.\nThe result of deleting the edges should give you a mesh that looks like this:\nRotate the camera slightly. Then select the very top edge in the inner basin (it\u0026rsquo;s marked in orange in the image below). That edge looks too sharp, so we will bevel it (this will hold our UVs better).\nWhile holding the selection from the previous step, press \u0026ldquo;CTRL+E\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard to start a Bevel. Drag the mouse slightly and click away for the context menu to show up. In the menu, use the settings seen below: \u0026ldquo;Segments: 1\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Width: 0.0169m\u0026rdquo;.\nLook from above and zoom into the mesh. Select the very inner, final loop, where the mesh ends. Seen in orange below.\nPress \u0026ldquo;E\u0026rdquo; to extrude then \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo; to scale inwards. Scale down on all axis by any amount. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to close the loop yet.\nPress \u0026ldquo;M\u0026rdquo; on the keyboard. This will bring up the \u0026ldquo;merge\u0026rdquo; menu. From it select the top pick called \u0026ldquo;At Center\u0026rdquo;.\nThe final result should look like the closed cap seen here:\nWith all of the above, our geometry is done. Now lets double check our normal directions of our faces. Then lets UV map. Those are the two final steps before we call all of this done.\nStep Twelve - Faces Direction Let\u0026rsquo;s go out of \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo; and back into \u0026ldquo;Object Mode\u0026rdquo;.\nAs mentioned, we want to double check if our normals are pointing in the right direction. In Blender, unlike Maya and 3Ds Max, when the faces point in the wrong direction, we still see shaded result. In the other two modelling softwares instead we would be seeing invisible mesh, and when rotating the camera we would understand thats the issue. Here instead we want to enable \u0026ldquo;Face Orientation\u0026rdquo; viewport setting so we can observe any issues.\nClick the arrow (number 1 marked in the image below.) Then tick ON the \u0026ldquo;Face Orientation\u0026rdquo; box in the menu that pops up. This is marked as (number 2) in the image below. Your mesh should then turn into a blue color.\nIf your mesh is red, that means your normals are facing the other way (inverted normals). This means that when seen from this upper side, the mesh will be invisible once in Unreal.\nTo fix our faces direction (normal directions), first press CTRL+A to open the \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; submenu (make sure the mesh is first selected). From that menu select \u0026ldquo;All Transform\u0026rdquo;. In cases where the mesh had some crazy transformations not applied yet, the above step fixes the normals and makes it all blue. In this case chances are it wont fix it for you, but its a good thing to remember and always do anyway (to Apply - All Transformations).\nWith All Transformation applied, if your mesh is still red, go back into \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;. Press \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; to select all faces. Then press \u0026ldquo;CTRL + N\u0026rdquo; to open the \u0026ldquo;Normals\u0026rdquo; context menu. From it pick the top option - \u0026ldquo;Flip\u0026rdquo;. The mesh will then turn blue. You can go back to Object Mode and disable the \u0026ldquo;Face Orientation\u0026rdquo; coloration from the viewport menu seen few steps before.\nStep Thirteen - UV Mapping Select the UV Editing Blender UI layout. On the right side, go into \u0026ldquo;Edit Mode\u0026rdquo;. Press \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; to select all faces.\nPress \u0026ldquo;F3\u0026rdquo; to open \u0026ldquo;Operator Search\u0026rdquo; (some people bind this to Space Bar on keyboard). In the search type \u0026ldquo;Unwrap\u0026rdquo; and select it.\nTip:\nIf you need more context as to what the - Menu Search - or - Operator Search - is and how to open it, check out the link to the official Blender Docs that I\u0026#39;ve put below.\nBlender Docs link.\nWe are done! Your UVs should look like below and they are exactly what we need. We are all wrapped up with the geometry section of this tutorial.\nConclusion This completes the geometry we need. You can export you Static Mesh as you usually do, and import it in Unreal. If you are using Unreal 5, then tick \u0026ldquo;Import as Nanite\u0026rdquo; off, as we need this as ordinary static geometry. We will explain why that is in the next parts of the tutorial. That is where we will cover how to created the textures necessary and then how to assemble the Unreal material shader.\nNext part of the tutorial: \u0026ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two\u0026rdquo;. It covers creating the textures necessary for the VFX. We will be working in Substance Designer.\nCheers,\nPete.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

You can move that slider to reveal two images positioned over one another. Handy for wireframe and tech views of meshes and environments!\nGive it a go:\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rThe crystal prop, seen from a very close up camera. Image to the left shows the initial, primitive shapes blockout as directly taken from Blender. Image to the right showcases a more detailed sculpt pass from inside Zbrush, then taken back in UE5 and rendered with a shiny, purple, preview material. I hope you like it and find the reveal screenshots in it cool. Detailed write up on what we are seeing in the images above, you can read in the blog post further down.\nMain Angle My attention in the scene, at this stage of the development, had been at crawling around roots and vines. I wanted to populate the walls so they have more visual interest through some props that break up their monotonous, bare look.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve missed reading about my approach to making those roots and the Blueprints and splines I used in the process, you can go back to the previous entry of this series and read it here.\nWhen I was at the above stage, I remember thinking that the walls indeed look a bit more interesting now. The roots in front and the way they curl here and there, was giving a nice dimension and in some spots casting great shadows and ambient occlusion.\nThe thing was that the roots even warm in color and bright in the spots where the bark had been exposed, still looked relatively gray and merging with the walls color and texturing. As such I continued to have a big worry about color. I thought that the runes I\u0026rsquo;ve scattered around, the stone tablets and trim sheets with green color are all nice. I kept it overall saturated green, even though the space looks forsaken and old. Yet it felt like that green is not enough. It didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be in juxtaposition to the grays of the old stone surfaces. In turn that was making the environment look rather flat and dull.\nColor Tests That\u0026rsquo;s when I decided to have an experiment of seeing what colors could be more exciting and look more invigorating than the current motives shaded in green.\nHere I was mainly experimenting with the colors. However, I also quickly blocked out a pod shaped flower prop. I wanted to give that a bit of a glow. That was yet another way to splash some more color, given that the pods were going to be frequent and placed on top of the roots. In the last image (purple version, lower right corner) you can also see some actual flower foliage too. I thought that the lower ground levels were still mostly empty, even with the new roots and pottery. As such I decided to splash around some foliage and grass. The foliage, I thought, could on purpose have colorful petals that match whatever the main color in the scene was going to be.\nFlower Foliage Creating these flowers really was an experiment that went quick and straightforward thanks to Nanite. Being in UE5 and using Nanite meant I could try out whatever petals and stems I liked. I could keep them geometry and not have to be concerned with baking them down to flat atlas textures.\nIf I were to use these props for an optimized game project, instead of just a pretty environment art scene, I would most definitely want to take the foliage one step forward and create some aggressive level of detail (LODs). It would also be good to bake the meshes into LOD cards. Nanite dynamically manages triangle counts very well, and one would think LODs are not necessary, but LODs are just way too good to be entirely removed. In the latest seasons of Fortnite, for example, where the game runs on UE5 with Nanite and Lumen, if one pays close attention, one can still see switches going from a Nanite mesh to an LOD super lowpoly static mesh or to a flat card billboard.\nConcept Paintover I had put in flowers and more color. Yet I could not make up my mind on my own as to if I wanted red, blue or purple as the main motive. As such I kept sending different angled screenshots of those color versions to my friend Oliver.\nOllie didn\u0026rsquo;t reply immediately but instead later that day he came back to me with a surprise paint over. He had taken one of my screenshots, seen the color variations I offer, heard the pitch where I was thinking out loud about how I want to replace the Houdini orb in the middle for a crystal. With those things in mind he made a really gorgeous concept paint over, featuring the colors he thought would be best plus a floating crystal visualization in the middle.\nThis angle above is the one Ollie took. And this is what he created:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a stunning paintover.\nI was incredibly surprised and inspired when he showed it to me. I could not stop staring at it. In the following weeks, in the moments I felt down or like I don\u0026rsquo;t have the energy to keep working on the scene, his concept art was what energized me and kept me going.\nOllie visualized quite a few ideas I had in my mind but never got to trying out at that stage too. Later on I kept that paintover as a guide to what I want to do and try next, after I were finished with changing the Houdini orb to a crystal.\nFew examples are the mist, clouds and fog surrounding the room. I thought they were very moody and nice and later in the project I filled the gaps of the platforms with VFX clouds using FluidNinja (something we will look at in detail in later blog entries).\nThe idea of the beams of light, like lasers, striking through the room and casting light as if offset in chroma to be both blue and purple, I thought was absolutely mind blowing. I tried that later on too. I did get a version of it working using spotlights and point lights. It was making the performance in the scene muddy though, as light overlaps was way too large, causing pixels on some surfaces to be lit too many times.\nAs such I had to instead try and \u0026ldquo;bake\u0026rdquo; the moving light effect through gradients created directly in the PBR shaders used for the floor and wall pieces. Something that I thought was a cool idea but didn\u0026rsquo;t get the chance to fully implement. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll revisit this idea from Ollie some other time, as an exercise in Tech Art.\nFrom an Orb to a Crystal With Ollies concept guiding me I set off to replace the orb in the middle. For the time being I committed to a purple color too.\nI have to admit it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel amazing to remove the orb. I had invested a lot of energy and time, learning how to make it in Houdini. In the shots seen in the past blog posts it might be static and boring. But it actually had a fluid sim animation on top. I had learned how to do Vertex Animation Textures (VAT) through it and of course the orb was very close to my heart.\nNo matter that though, I knew that the scene needed something different. An abstract, moving orb like that is cool, but perhaps in another environment and another context.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to remind yourself of what VATs are and how the fluid animation looks, the one I refer to above, you can do so over at - The Amarantos Ritual - 01 - Beginning.\nOrb Sculpt I blocked out the initial orb and crystal pieces in Blender. From there I took it into Zbrush where I cleaned up my topology to hold better brush strokes. I subdivided to get myself to a high polycount but didn\u0026rsquo;t go overly high. I knew I wanted Nanite meshes at the end and as such I mainly was after creating detailed and interesting silhouettes.\nOllie had went for staggering blues and purples in the concept paint over. With purple being his favourite color too, I went for that as a main motive for quite a while.\nLater on, though, I once again struggled with color. I set off to texture the surface of the crystal and whatever textures and patterns I would try, with purple as dominant color, it kept giving me results way too noisy and busy.\nI discovered that my mistake was to not rely on the already detailed geometry through Nanite and use simple albedo and normals on top. As in no overly complex and colorful albedo with edge details derived from curvature or thickness bakes. Also no normal map overcomplicating by having any of the edges pop in or out, to give them more dimension, again by deriving detail from smart masks using curvature or thickness.\nInstead the albedo would be very flat. The normal map - nonexistent in the unique UV textures. The geometry was detailed so it didn\u0026rsquo;t need any normal maps a part from detail tiling surface normals.\nAs such in the shader of the crystal I did the following:\nUnique UV texture: the Albedo channel. Some Roughness too.\nTiling texture UV channels added on top of that: two Normal maps. One with large tiling gaussian imperfections and dots. One with smaller tiled plasma-like noise, sharpened to look more like a crystal matrix.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I went a way from the purple and more towards blue. But Ollies love for purple extended as a love for purple in me and later in the projects I found other opportunities to bring back some of those hues.\nCrystal Work In the two images below, put on top of one another, you can inspect the difference between the crystal blockout and the Zbrush sculpt pass:\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rThe crystal prop, zoomed in by a camera in Unreal. Image on the left is a Blender blockout. Image on the right is a Zbrush sculpture pass. Both have gray, placeholder material. I prefer to blockout my shapes in Blender as I feel quicker over there. Then once I like the overall appearance, I take the blocks inside Zbrush where I Dynamesh and subdivide to then sculpt on top. As seen above (make sure you moved the white bar in the middle, so you could see the comparison between the two pictures).\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rAnother look at the crystal prop. This is from the same angle as before. The left picture is identical to one of the previous. The right, however, has a purple, glossy, placeholder, material test. Before heading into Substance Painter to bake any channels or start any serious texturing, I tested the purple colors and how the shapes react to light once they are more glossy (seen above).\nUV Maps Once I liked what Im seeing as a preview above, I exported a slightly decimated geometry version of the sculpt. I set off to UV map it:\nI UV map in Blender by adding seams by hand and then running an unwrap command. As long as you put in good seams, the unwrap comes out pretty good and doesn\u0026rsquo;t even need you to polish it by relaxing the shells or tweaking them by hand.\nThe mesh, as mentioned few times by now, was meant to be Nanite, as such I kept it a bit denser on poly. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to run it through automatic UV mapping because it would have split it into many triangles and needlessly cut UV shells. If that happened, not only would its appearance not be so good after texturing, but it would also increase file sizes exponentially, given we are dealing with high geometry counts.\nTexture Baking With the UV mapping done I went into Substance Painter in order to bake some texture channels. I had a dense Nanite mesh, so I anticipated that I will probably not put a lot of importance on things like unique Normal Maps, instead I would tile normal map noises in the engine itself. Which is exactly what happened with the crystal parts of the prop.\nI wanted to splash interesting colors and figure out what the patterns and tiling normal maps I might use would be, be it inside Painter or UE5. As such in Substance Designer I made these two:\nBack to Unreal With the above things drafted, I started experimenting with using the Substance Designer graphs. I did that inside of Painter for the most part, and struggled once I previewed it inside Unreal 5. I say struggled mainly because I was not convinced by the visual and disliked most of it.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rLeft image shows the crystal with a purple, glossy placeholder. Image to the right is my first attempt at texturing it. The color is still purple, but its bathed in white and gray noises and patterns. There is a lot of dark colored edges too. In this first test above, you can clearly see how using my exciting, very detailed Substance Designer material graphs, gave everything an incredibly heavy, noisy and terrible visual look.\nThe flat purple had a simplicity that was beautiful and now lacking.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rLeft is the before image - the purple crystal with heavy white splashes on top. To the right is a new test with more blue and lighter color edge damage. The blue even if slightly better is still incredibly noisy in this image. I could see the issues I described in the sentence above, but I could not exactly figure out how to solve them. As such I tried to simplify - less colors, less noise, and what if I tried blue?\nThat was still wrong - the look was still noisy. The albedo rich in mud, the edge color derived from the curvature and thickness bakes was way too overpowering too.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rImage to the left is the before seen blue with lots of noise in albedo on top. The new image, to the right, is a more ocean-like blue with giant splashes of white color, instead of smaller noises. I started to realize slowly its all too noisy so I started to simplify the albedo. What if it were blue but with larger tiled splashes of color, instead of small noise? Seen above.\n(By the way, that albedo splash of color seen above is still one of my initial Substance Designer graphs. Here though its only used as albedo. The other channels are off. In Designer I had exposed lots of parameters such as color, noise type, noise size and overall tiling, among many other. As such here I reused my work by just changing parameters so the splashes are giant and not tiny, thus noisy.)\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rLeft image is the blue, bright crystal with ocean like patterns. The right is a new test again with purple and lots of edge detail. But that was too simple, and too bright. As such, a step back again, seen above. I tried purple again, tried edge detail, but more controlled. It was still way too noisy again!\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rImage on the left is the purple with the heavy edge detail. New one on the right is a darker purple and bigger splashes of color. No edge detail. There is also big splashes of cyan. As such I removed the edge detail, went back to flat purples and blues. But this time the crystal looked like from an ice cream advert\u0026hellip; (colors seen in right image above).\nI removed the purples and made the overall tones darker, less in the splashes of an ice cream advert visual.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rLeft image is the crystal with purple and cyan splashes. To the right is an even more simplified, overall more blue and dark version. I was still in love with the idea of purple that Ollie had given me. So even though I left it for the time being, later on I returned to it.\nAt this stage the crystal was a bit dark but I was making progress. It being darker and slightly more flat but shiny also helped me realize something else. It was the fact that if I wanted to capture the edges and give them detail, I should do it through Fresnel functions inside the Unreal material shader I was creating for this crystal. The fresnel for edges would work few times better and be more interesting than any albedo + normal + roughness edge detail created in Substance Painter. It would sit more elegant, more gem-like.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rLeft is the darker tone, blue crystal. To the right is an improvement on it where the colors are the same. However, there is a splash of white fresnel, giving it more edge detail. In the inside of the crystal there are also splashes of purple. If above, on the image to the right, you inspect the crystal dead middle of the picture, you can see few white lines. Those are the most staggering examples of the fresnel from the above camera angle.\nIt also added little rays of bounced light (well not really, its not real light, its all fake!) in the edges and crevices of the Nanite geometry. Something that again looks few times better than anything baked directly in the albedo.\nInteractive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.\rTo the left is the finished crystal, colored blue. To the right is the crystal again, but the rock orb is now textured too, with an appearance of stone. Lots of blue, tiny gems are masked on it now as well. I then went back in Substance Painter and textured the rock orb. If the blue crystal above uses a unique albedo + lots of fresnels + lots of tiling normal noises, then the rock instead uses only unique textures.\nThe rock is pretty much a standard PBR shader with nothing fancy going on. The blue gems on it that I masked and texture in Painter to match the color and patters of the crystal, I didn\u0026rsquo;t even give fresnel. Because they are overly shiny it sat fitting and okay, even without a fresnel, when compared to the rest of the crystal.\nThe final result, seen big (picture that you can click to zoom, unlike the before-and-after sliders above):\nRecap To recap some of the decisions, focusing on the crystal, blue part and putting them more as advise:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t put in albedo / roughness / normal details on the edges, through unique texture sets - instead use a Fresnel (this is our Fresnel Number One). Consider adding another Fresnel (this is our Fresnel Number Two). This one you can invert, so instead of shining as a cage around the edges of the geometry, it shines off the surfaces right in the middle of it, that look at us and at the camera angle. Instead of having busy unique normal details, consider tiling one surface detail with large dents and imperfections, as if looking at scratched surface. Tile another one right after - another normal detail - this time for smaller, micro imperfections. The scene from afar When looking at these shots, the lighter tone blues that you can observe in the lower part of the orb and its gem, are direct result from a fresnel of that color. This showcases how useful the fresnels are in making the whole illusion of looking at something that is a crystal.\nCredits Oliver Harbour, who did the initial scene paint over with the crystal seen in this blog, is an illustrator and a concept artist. You can find his work over at his website. He is also on Twitter, Instagram and Artstation.\nOlivers help was inspirational and invaluable to me. Later on he also concepted some original crown designs for the character seen in the cinematic short of this project. We will take a look at a detailed breakdown of that headpiece crown and the concept art in a later blog entry.\nConclusion In this blog entry we looked at picking colors. We went for red, then to blue, switched to purple, and then back to blue. But along the way, while testing those colors, we learned a lot about what works and what doesn\u0026rsquo;t. As such it was a fruitful experimentation.\nWe then went through a detailed breakdown of the texturing process of the crystal, as seen through lots of before-and-after image sliders.\nAs mentioned a few times, I went for an overall blue tone, but the help and inspiration from the concepts and the purple colors that Ollie did, were incredibly important for me. I mentioned this too, but later on in the project I revisited and relit the room a few times. That was in order to create a secondary \u0026ldquo;realm\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;world\u0026rdquo; of the scene, to be used in a cinematic short.\nIn that, I settled onto purple colors that are incredibly exciting and intriguing, and in later entries we will look at those in detail as well.\nCheers,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

I showed how the mesh underwent a few changes, getting it from alien crop circles appearance to a more ordinary brick and pavement look. You could revisit those screenshots over here - The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference.\nI did, however, slightly skip over looking at the lower walls of the environment and what I did with their sculpts. I also mentioned that we should look at the upper parts of the scene too, and briefly talk about the wall pieces, windows, and dome elements there.\nRoof Blockout Taking a step back, in this screenshot seen below we can see my initial blockout of the ceiling. My approach to putting the place together was as follows: I blocked out the lower levels walls. I put in the middle platform so the orb is centered, floating on it. I added little bridges and a bunch of pillars. I then added one upper level of walls - the ones where the circumference of the room shrinks once for the first time. It creates a dome like appearance where the pillars are. The walls above get to host some circle cut windows.\nOnce I had all of this blocked out, I set on to sculpt further all of the above described assets. After sculpting them I did an initial texturing pass. Even then, when I still had no roof, I knew I want to create a dome appearance on the upper ceilings. I knew I want to open up a tall space around there and not end up the celling ending close to the orb, thus making a claustrophobic space.\nEven though I knew and was planning all of that I had still not made most of the blockout upper assets and ceiling pieces.\nInstead once I had done the first sculpting and texturing pass of the lower levels, and once I had seen it work well and I liked it, I set off to continue the missing ceiling.\nThat is how the upper levels looked - in mid-blockout - when I was testing out the shapes.\nNot only were I testing out the visual and silhouette of the shapes themselves but I also was engaged fully into looking at something else too: their use with light. I wanted to create interesting patterns at the very top that then would flood the lower parts of the environment in light that leaves spellbinding, exciting shadow silhouettes. Here light itself was my main attention and my main \u0026ldquo;asset\u0026rdquo;. It dictated what was going to happen with the sculpture pieces. Light inspired me in the making of the flower-like opening on the top.\nHaving figured what pieces work and what pieces I like from the initial Blender blockouts, I set off to take some of them inside Zbrush. The modular building pieces that I liked I retopologized in Zbrush using Dynamesh. I then further sculpted and polished details on top. Some I duplicated multiple times and shattered in different ways, deriving me extra dressings and details.\nAs a final step inside Zbrush I used Decimation Master in order to lower the polycount of each sculpt. I had most pieces sitting at 2-3 million tris. Nanite could handle that but it would result with each mesh being around 200-300 MBs, maybe even more. I found that would be needless given that this high density of poly was not exactly looking more detailed than a well decimated version that would be 100-200k tris (instead of 2-3m). The file sizes of those would be much more manageable.\nWe need to remember that we need to UV map these too. UV Mapping a 3m triangles sculpt would be much more taxing on Blender (and on us) than a 300k tris one, which would be a trivial task to uv map if one has a polished, good geometry.\nDoor Asset The above described process I used for the creation of the front door as well.\nI made a quick shape exploration in Blender before moving anything into Zbrush. I played with an array modifier with rotations in order to try and get some interesting shape. Here I once again thought at light as my main asset, as such I wanted to create some silhouette that once lit would aggressively cast some interesting shadows in the middle of the room.\nThe walls to the left and the right were shapes just for placeholder as I knew I would use the existing modular walls in the project instead of making brand new ones unique to the corridor of this door.\nThere was slight difference in the process of making this door, when compared to the walls we looked at before. In here, I UV mapped my initial pieces and then in Zbrush used non-destructive approach both to the sculpting and the decimation of the topology by the end. That way I preserved my UV maps and didn\u0026rsquo;t have to re-map once the sculpts were ready.\nThis is the same approach I used for the circular platform in the middle.\nAbove is a detailed look at my sculpt pass on the door. I\u0026rsquo;ve not included the spiral shape as I thought its not necessary to run a sculpting pass on it - instead it could be ordinary Nanite mesh with just a tiling material on top.\nAfter the sculpt was done I decimated the asset while preserving UVs. I went into Substance Painter where I baked my maps and set off to texture. In the image above the UVs differ slightly compared to the Blender shots before. That\u0026rsquo;s mainly because I did some extra polish before taking it outside of Blender and into Zbrush. With that I utilized my UV space better to not have the empty space seen in the first Blender UV screenshot.\nGod Rays Alpha Cards Once the ceiling and the dome appearance was created I put in some god rays and atmospheric 2D alpha cards. Those face the camera at most of the times and if you wanted similar ones you could dig out materials and blueprints set ups from Epic over here - \u0026ldquo;Blueprints - Legacy UE4 Sample Project\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is UE4 and its marked as Legacy in some spots, but the Blueprint set up (and materials) found in there for \u0026ldquo;God Rays\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Fog Cards\u0026rdquo; are set up incredibly well. Their design and function stands perfect even when migrated in UE5.\nRoots I had the alpha card rays implemented and my attention came back entirely on the lower parts of the scene. Where all of the \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; would take place.\nI looked at it and could see that it was sitting predominantly empty. No detail props or set dressings. Even the walls met the floors at a perfect 90 degrees angle which took away from the natural look of the space and made for an artificial CG look.\nI wanted to remedy that. As such I looked into making bundles of props I could scatter around and about. Pottery, ground dirt pile, smashed pieces of pots. Stone tablets with inscriptions or symbols on them. Fallen parts of the upper ceiling pillars, now sitting on the dusty floor.\nYet my walls remained empty. Overly simple. The upper parts of the environment had cracks and tons of damages on the walls, spilling in even further light and using that as a detailing asset. But the lower ones? They were mostly intact. Empty. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to dig out any holes there because the camera would be seeing straight out of them. That would break immersion, because, as you could guess, the exterior scene is completely empty. As such that idea was a no go.\nThat is when I started thinking about roots. What if oversized, magical, incredibly wide roots were spiraling around like snakes? They could populate the walls better and reach towards the middle of the room, towards the floating orb.\nI pitched that idea out loud to my friend Sophie Deschamps. She loved the idea so much, and being the cool artist she is, without me even asking, took the screenshot I had just sent her and painted over it.\nShe got me this artwork:\nSeeing this concept paint over, I knew immediately. I knew that indeed this is the next move and as such I set of to making some roots.\nI could not describe how helpful and inspiring this paint over was, as such, thank you, Sophie!\nBlueprints for the Roots My process behind making the roots was at first in big chunk in UE5 itself. The space is already blocked out and I wanted to have a direct and immediate way to \u0026ldquo;crawl\u0026rdquo; around different roots and see their influence and shape on the environment. As such I used a spline system Blueprint directly in UE5.\nI could have opened Blender and positioned my floor and walls in the configuration I have in the scene. That would be a trivial and not very time consuming task as I already have all of my measurements set. Its just a matter of moving them from one place to another.\nYet I dislike jumping in and out of Unreal. I like doing as much as I could in the engine itself as that then keeps my art process with less friction. Frictionless means more creativity and energy spend towards whatever I am creating and not the dialogue that I have between the different software packages.\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing a tutorial titled \u0026ldquo;UE4 Tutorial: Add spline-meshes procedurally\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t know the YouTuber but this video, even though old, is very useful.)\n(Video above is UE4 but things seen in it should work well in UE5 too. If some parts are hard to follow, I suggest giving a go to this one instead - \u0026ldquo;Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial - Splines - Spline Meshes\u0026rdquo;. I remember using that at one point or another as well.)\nNot wanting to move between modelling packages, as mentioned already, I imported in UE5 a Blueprint system I had made years prior. It\u0026rsquo;s one that I had started for some random UE4 project I could not even remember now (tutorials for making similar blueprint are seen in the videos above).\nOver time I had carried it into my Orbital Gateway, (found here) where I had used it to scatter in line all of the metal platforms. It was also used to shape all of the big, vacuum like cables that are the kernel of the vision of that project. In that Gateway environment I had implemented some improvements into my initial spline Blueprint too. Things like being able to per instance basis pick different static mesh and different material to go onto the spline. It was a solution battle tested and as such I wanted to reuse it here.\nI went in Blender and I made an initial tube that I kept higher in poly than I usually do (as in with extra edge loops). Using Unreal 5 now, unlike back in my previous projects that were Unreal 4, here I could afford higher polycount with the knowledge that all of my blocked out pieces will end up being Nanite meshes.\nThat tube I put into the spline Blueprint. Over the course of a few days I slowly build up bundles of large roots. Those were blockout so if any when taking a turn in the world were looked lowpoly, or any surface got distorted, it didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. I wanted to block them out directly in UE5 but I still had in mind exporting the resulted meshes back into Blender in order to polish the visual slightly and UV map them by the end.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good to mention that I\u0026rsquo;ve not implemented control over the thickness of my splines on per spline point basis. As such I could not select a middle point of a root and scale it up to give it thickness. Instead I exported my uniformly thick roots from Unreal.\nFirst step to do that was to Merge Actors by selecting the spline - opening \u0026ldquo;Merge Actors\u0026rdquo; from the Tools submenu - hitting \u0026ldquo;Merge Actors\u0026rdquo; (you can see that in the image below).\nThat would ask me a location to save the spline as a static mesh under the Project Directory. I then navigate to it in the Content Browser, right click on its icon and go to - Asset Actions - Export. That allows me to save the resulting mesh outside of UE5 as an *.fbx. I open that in Blender and I do my thickness scale up polish, UV polish, and subdivision to make it even smoother Nanite mesh. I import that back into UE5 and I replace the original spline blueprints.\nIn the paint over from Sophie the roots were incredibly large and impressive. I slowly build up mine to be large too. But I knew I will probably keep them smaller than her concept. I took that decision with the idea of keeping the focal point to be the orb. I thought that if I introduced roots that were very, very thick, they would draw viewers attention. Also I though that if indeed they were that big, I would need to figure out some set dressings and props to put on their surface, as to not leave them too bare, empty, boring and lacking detail.\nFilling up the Empty Parts With those roots looked at, we could take one step back and see the build up of set dressings in one corner of the environment. That way you could get a better perception of how all of the described details and props added up to build up the picture.\nImage above shows a dirty looking Zbrush sculpt I made. It looks not that amazing in the Zbrush render, but once placed in the world with a tiling ground dirt material, to match the floors already there, it helped hide the 90 degrees I mentioned some time ago.\nI then polished and revamped the pillars (image above). I wanted to give them better shape and texture. Something more realistic and intricate than the first draft. I also added pottery.\nHere we can see the influence of the roots. I textured them using tiling materials from Megascans that I mixed in my own way using triplanar mapping in my UE5 shader. There is also a slight jump with me introducing some foliage and flower pods, but we will go into describing that process in the next post.\nCredits Sophie Deschamps, who did the paint over seen in this entry, is a Level Artist at Ubisoft Montpellier. You can find and follow her work over at Twitter and Artstation.\nConclusion In this post we saw the scene fill up with props, dressings and more detail. We looked at using Blueprints spline systems for blocking out roots directly in UE5.\nThere was, however more going on during, and immediately after everything seen above. It was experiment and struggle with color that persisted for a little while.\nI attempted different color combinations where the roots flower blooms would light up the scene in blues, purples, reds, oranges. The orb would carry on that color in its fresnel too. Experimenting and switching between those colors went on for a while and then I got some ideas and help from another friend, just the way Sophie helped and inspired me with the roots.\nNext up we will look at that and how that influenced changing the orb in the middle for something else.\nCheers,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

You can source your idea or inspiration by mixing together existing paintings, photos, short stories, books and more. It\u0026rsquo;s also integral to look at real life photos. We aim for believable and realistic spaces and layouts (or at least I do in this project). That is even when our subjects are fantastical. As such parts of what we are about to create needs to be grounded on reality. Those parts need to have roots in what is already familiar in the viewers eyes. Then on top you sprinkle bit of the eerie, unknown, novel and bizarre.\nCurrent Stage At the end of the previous blog (The Amarantos Ritual - 01 - Beginning) after figuring out my Houdini orb and that it will be the center piece of the composition and the layout, I was at this stage of the scene:\nI did some further tweaks and added a little bridge platforms to connect the middle, circular platform to the outer edges of the room. In the very dead center, I cut a gap in order to place more \u0026ldquo;liquid metal\u0026rdquo; type of effect. I wanted to lead to the idea that perhaps in that basin in the middle of the room, there was an inactive substance. Few people, aliens, or some other creatures, enter the room and interact with that inactive substance. With their presence, it comes to life. It forms into the orb that then starts to float in the upper, middle point, space of the large room.\nAs you perhaps remember from the last entry, I really wanted to lead towards the idea of a ritual happening in this space. The creatures that enter the room bring the orb to life. They perhaps worship it, fear it, but are also astonished by it. Does it bring them energy? Food? Pleasure?\nWhat is the relationship between these characters and this \u0026ldquo;inanimate\u0026rdquo; object that the next moment seems to come to life and be lively?\nWhen I start new scenes, or any other type of art, I usually make up a few sentences that form a story. The moment I have that I start to ask questions. Those questions are very much like the ones above. They help me refine and see more than what there is at first in my mind. They help me make a 3D space that is more believable, interesting and rich in story.\nThat is an exercise I think you should try yourself. Whenever you create a layout, ask yourself why its the way it is? When you place props, ask yourself why they are there and what their relation to other objects around them is? Ask how you can tie up one item to another so they look more coherent?\nBefore diving into more screenshots inside this 3D space, lets take a step back. As mentioned in the start of this entry, I want to include my references and early influences behind the art.\nReferences I use PureRef to put all of my reference images in one place. I like using this piece of software because it\u0026rsquo;s very lightweight. Some people use Miro which has a similar idea but more annotation tools, sticky notes and other cool features. I\u0026rsquo;ve found that PureRef is easier on the RAM than having a webpage open or using the Miro desktop software.\nOn my ref board I make sure to mix plenty of 2D art, 3D art but also real life photographs.\nWhen it comes to ref boards, this one above I would rate as a relatively tiny. In most of my previous projects I\u0026rsquo;ve went through many more bundles of subjects and pictures and usually my boards expand much more than this.\nI think in the creation of this scene I\u0026rsquo;ve been more controlled on the scope of the pieces I want to capture and create. As such that is also reflected in my ref board.\nAnother thing to mention is that in the board above in some spots there are screenshots from the project itself. I like to screen cap where I am and put it right next to the reference in order to compare.\nInitial Goals Lets zoom in on some parts of the board above and see things further in detail.\nI want to tell you about the artists that inspired me and credit them properly in here.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t personally know any of them but their work is brilliant.\nBefore getting into this current ritual project I had spent a long while in another block out I was creating in Unreal Engine 5. It was the test scene where I transitioned from UE4 to UE5 and learned the intricacies of UE5s Nanite and Lumen. That project itself was in an \u0026ldquo;Early Preview\u0026rdquo; build of UE5 and had lots of issues and crashes. I never uploaded any screenshots from it, but at some point I might revisit it.\nBefore I got my hands on Early UE5, official demos such as \u0026ldquo;Lumen in the Land of Nanite\u0026rdquo;, then later \u0026ldquo;Valley of the Ancient\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;City Sample (The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal ENgine 5 Experience)\u0026rdquo; released. After reading official docs about Nanite and seeing the sculpts and works in those demos I put a goal for my project. That was to try and create sculpts that are as dense and details as some of the assets seen in there.\nWith that in mind, I came across the artworks in the image above. The left image, for example, is a sculpt by Musaab Shukri done exactly for the UE5 demo \u0026ldquo;Valley of the Ancient\u0026rdquo;. Work for Epic Games.\nImages to the right are concepts by Zak Foreman. Those are again for the same demos. It depicts the visual fidelity and detail richness that Nanite could pull off.\nHaving realized these will be my visual fidelity goals, I set forward to find some real life photographs again. Some real spaces to get inspired from even further.\nThe Diwan-i-Khas (India) The Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort), or Hall of Private Audiences is a location in India that I found lots of inspiration in. It\u0026rsquo;s not hard to see the resemblance in the intricate carvings here when compared to the previous UE5 demos artworks we saw.\nFrom the very early blockouts I had, I didn\u0026rsquo;t really plan to head towards red stone look like the above. I still thought that the carvings are amazing reference for the sculpts I had yet to create. Also for any texture work that would go on top.\nCircular Rooms I also pinned on my board some old, random photos of different circular rooms. I wanted a radial room after all, so I knew I should look at some from the get go.\nI was looking at different spaces that have above light leaking in and creating nice god rays. When showing my very early blockouts to some friends, they all mentioned \u0026ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus\u0026rdquo; as a game that has very impressive interior shots with lighting just like that one. I\u0026rsquo;ve not played the game myself yet, but I knew I had to put those nice screenshots from it on my moodboard.\nStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Order When I\u0026rsquo;m creating a project I always have immediate influence from the games I am playing at the time. In this case I was playing through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order when creating parts of this environment. These screenshots from the game came into the board relatively late. Yet they (and the game) had a big influence on some of the decision making I took. It also helped me solve some visual issues I had and introduce more details like crack decals on the walls.\nI particularly looked at this section of the images, seen below:\nI looked at the decal work and base texturing here and found lots of inspiration. Later on I needed more props to populated my empty spaces with, and after being inspired by Jedi I created ground dirt scatter piece as well as a set of pots - some intact, some smashed into pieces. I will showcase these later on.\nCollaborators Later through the project I had the pleasure to be inspired and helped by few more artists. Those are some of my friends and their influence here was direct.\nHayley Rumbold joined me in the creation of this project as a collaborator and a Cinematic Artist.\nOliver Harbour did concept paint overs + few original pieces.\nSophie Deschamps gave me feedback a long the way and did a paint over as well.\nPhil Cockburn left me lots and lots of tips and feedback through it all too.\nI wanted to mention them now though I will show you the works they created and the amazing influence they had in more detail inside the next blog entries.\nInitial Assets Having seen most of the reference images, we could step back now and see some of the first blockout shapes I made in Blender.\nThese are some of the pieces I initially made and blocked out the scene. Some artists use Zbrush to block out pieces like that. I prefer to make these using a subdivision workflow, directly in Blender. I start by extruding a cube around and then beveling it in such a way that when I apply a Catmull-Clark subdivision on top, I get smooth, but not overly smooth shapes.\nI make an absolute mess of the geometry. In some cases I insert lots of ngons (not seen in many obvious places here, but I still do). When using Catmull-Clark I don\u0026rsquo;t really care about my geometry flow mainly because I know the algorithm will make all of it into quads by the end when applied. If those quads follow awful edge loops, I frankly don\u0026rsquo;t mind. I don\u0026rsquo;t because I know that what I am making is then directly going into Zbrush. Once in there I will Dynamesh to get my to a density of geometry I like. When I do that any bad edge loops and flows gets retopologized to something much better.\nHere is an example of a resulting topology (image above). One that actually is pretty clean compared to some of the descriptions I wrote above, that happen most of the time.\nSome of the walls I later duplicated a few times in Blender:\nTo then as described above take into Zbrush:\nWhere I refined my geometry, made topology that can hold good brush stokes and then detailed on top to get me to more finalized assets.\nAs this all is an exercise in Nanite, I was not scared to be dense in topology and detail. I tried to make silhouettes rich in detail where the cracks and damages are. In some of the other wall pieces, I stamped stencil details in the form of writings, symbols and ritualistic stone carvings. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to rely on baking those down onto a lower poly, but instead use Decimation Master in Zbrush to get me to a lower dense poly, suitable for Nanite (as in being 150-200k tris. Even though Nanite could totally handle keeping some of the sculpts at 2-3m tris, it proved to be pointless and not add much detail).\nPlatform Sculpts My platform in the very center of the middle, I kept as one big shape. That is the first prop seen in the Blender screenshots above. Keeping it one big shape might sound a bit insane because it might be incredibly hard to keep high texel density even on 4k textures. That\u0026rsquo;s given how large the entire piece is. As such I briefly considered making a pie cut 1/4 of it, to then rotate by copying 3 more times and getting me the entire circle. I decided against that mainly for one reason: I knew I will create a dense Nanite mesh. As such I knew that most of my detail will sit in the geometry itself. If on top a slightly lower density albedo texture went, I decided it would not be a problem. Sculpting details on a platform this large on top, would also be quite fun.\nFor the outer ring platform that wraps around that same platform, I decided to use the \u0026ldquo;pie cut\u0026rdquo; approach. I did that mainly because with its radius going further out the main platform, its cover area increased. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t scared of the texel density (though at that point I should have been) but more of the chore that sculpting such a giant piece would turn into, if I were to keep the entire ring a unique prop, instead of a pie cut. As such I made it into a \u0026ldquo;modular\u0026rdquo; cut and duplicated it many times in the scene, rotating it about, building up the rooms floor.\nThe above image was the first sculpt I did on the platform right after I took it into Zbrush. Going back to that talk about \u0026ldquo;familiar vs novel\u0026rdquo; right at the start of this blog, with this sculpt I later started to worry that the swirling, circular motives looked too alien. They are nice in an \u0026ldquo;alien crop circles\u0026rdquo; kind of way. But are they perhaps too abstract for this scene? Making everything look too smooth, too fudged and non-concrete?\nAs such I went back and sculpted it once more. This time around keeping a certain array of circles towards the middle, but in the outer parts giving a more structured, brick appearance. Seen in the image above.\nScene Shots Looking at the platform in the context of the scene:\nAbove is the old version. Below is the new one. I also put in some scene lights recolors and texture recolors to give everything a more controlled and realistic appearance.\nZoomed in towards the middle, we can inspect the platform and the \u0026ldquo;darkness basin\u0026rdquo; in the middle too:\nIn the gaps of the bricks I put in flat planes. On those I added a liquid metal texture. At some point I was imagining the idea of cutting little canals going from the middle basin towards the outsides of the platform. In those canals liquid full of white stars would flow.\nI thought its an interesting idea but I later abandoned it as I was worried that after introducing some other details on the outskirts of the scene, having black and white, high contrast, liquid in the cracks of the platforms proved to introduce visual clutter. It was making the scene fall a part more than it was tying it together or the novelty of the idea was worth.\nIn the next blog post we will look at the upper parts of the scene. We will inspect all of the wall and dome pieces seen in the Blender screenshots above which I used to create the higher parts of the scene.\nI also revamped the pillars, just the way I reworked the middle platform above. I gave them more structure, carved runes and interest.\nI hope you enjoyed seeing all of this,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

It\u0026rsquo;s process documented both in writing and in work-in-progress images has been scattered across my social channels. I\u0026rsquo;ve got a lot of positive comments and encouragement a long the way by some wonderful people. Some of you, dear readers, might have even seen the project and the aforementioned images already. I wanted to still pull it all together, so to speak, into one condensed place. Tie up the scattered posts and ends.\nIn that tie up, I hope for some of you to find inspiration. Others I hope find insight and resources towards what and how I set to accomplish the things I have in my scene.\nAbove is the first screenshot I took inside the environment scene. An orange, abstract, floating, orb. This had been an experiment of importing an animated orb directly from Houdini.\nProject Beginning In March 2022 I was experimenting with a small game prototype I had started in Unreal Engine 4. It was a topdown camera RPG with lots of spells and action. I never got to the part of prototyping much of this \u0026ldquo;action\u0026rdquo; but I did blueprint a lot of the initial movement, camera work, and then also had started on a few spells and abilities.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t exactly be going into details about the prototype itself as that would call for another long post of its own, and would branch us away from the topic of this current scene. The context important to the start of this environment is that in early July 2022, after creating the initial Blueprints foundation for a few abilities inside the game, I set off to learn and experiment with Houdini.\nThe thought process behind getting into Houdini was that I wanted to create some spells VFX and animations. But the idea I had in mind was for fluidity and smooth movement, one that would be accomplished through fluid simulations. Yet for obvious performance and scaling reasons I could not get into creating actual real time fluid simulations (not that I have the knowledge to do that even if there is a way to scale it performance wise [I bet there is, smart people out there certainly have accomplished it]).\nThese orbs above are my initial Houdini experiments, as seen imported inside my UE4 game prototype. They have a looping animation attached to them. You can see preview of it further down in this post in some of the YouTube embeds.\nVertex Animation Textures In the years prior I had heard a lot about the technique of baking down animations in vertex look-up tables. Those end up in the form of a bitmap that then is read from a shader in order to tell each triangle of the mesh how and where to move to. Interpolate between those different key \u0026ldquo;positions\u0026rdquo; on the texture and you get an animation (this is an incredibly oversimplified explanation, apologies to anyone that might be reading it and happen to be the type of Tech Artist to implement these amazing things from the absolute scratch!).\nThis type of technique is called Vertex Animation Textures (VAT).\nAnimations in the form of VAT have one incredible advantage over other type of game animations: it\u0026rsquo;s entirely driven in a shader. Onto the GPU. We don\u0026rsquo;t use or deploy any types of bones or skeletons and as such any object you animate in this way can end up as a Static Mesh. The animation, as I mentioned, then happens on the GPU through the reading of the vertex look-up table texture.\nThere is memory footprint, of course. It comes in the form of the quite oversized in width and height look-up textures (which makes them have large file sizes). Also for a smooth and interesting \u0026ldquo;fluid\u0026rdquo; like animation, your Static Mesh might end up being quite rich on polycount too.\nVAT Demonstration In this first picture you can see a fuzzy ball mesh I created parametrically in Houdini.\nI then imported that mesh inside Unreal 4. I didn\u0026rsquo;t export it from Houdini as an ordinary static geometry. Instead I exported it as a VAT and in Unreal used a SideFX plugin and shader.\nBut that orb, seen appearing like a proper mesh, is after the SideFX shader for reading VATs has been applied. If we ignore that shader and take a look at the geometry that the VAT exports, without material graph or the vertex look-up table textures that are generated, this is how it looks:\nAs mentioned already, image above is orb imported in Unreal but no VAT textures are applied yet. As such its a collection of what to us appears like arbitrary placed triangles.\nUseful VATs Why use VATs in the first place?\nWhen we try to animate, say hundreds or thousands of actors onto the scene, all visible, even if they are incredibly low-poly, and use no complex textures to drag down our texture streaming budget, we often will still hit performance issues and hardly have any low MS (high FPS).\nOne of the reasons for that is because when we display on the screen actors like that, ones with skeleton rig animations, they each end up being a separate draw call. Those draw calls go through the CPU and as such we end up being bound on CPU before we even get to use much of the potential that our GPU has.\nAs such the VAT is a trade-off where we might increase slightly the polycount, increase the use of textures budged, but end up with incredibly optimized amount of draw calls. The orbs you see above, I could render 100-200 of them in the scene, visible from one camera angle at all time, and still have low MS and good performance.\nAnimation In addition to the above, there is also the more obvious part. It\u0026rsquo;s the content of the animations. In Houdini I wanted to make some fluids like sims that I could perhaps pull of through a shader in Unreal entirely. It would require of me to offset my orb surfaces with World Position Offset to give it a fuzzy, liquid like movement on its surface. But then if I wanted the visual to look proper and as cool as the ones in the VATs it would mean I need to recalculate my normals as well so light bounces off those WPO surface movements correctly.\nI think I will give a go at recalculating normals and making a shader like that at some point in Unreal. But for now I wanted to use the opportunity to learn fluid sims in Houdini and then learn VATs.\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing an orb with fluid like movement animation.)\nThe animation, seen after VAT import in Unreal. In this video below, the VAT shader is from SideFX but I have added control over Albedo, and Emission and I\u0026rsquo;ve plugged in a Fresnel function. It gives it the glowing effect.\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the VAT orbs but in UE5. These are now shaded and have more refined visuals.)\nFrankly, I found all of the above incredibly interesting and fascinating, even before I dived to learn the nitty-gritty of it all. I am not really a VFX artist or an animator. But I do have a love for Tech Art (even if I\u0026rsquo;m not a Tech Art in my fulltime studio job either!). My setting off into making these type of fluid like animations for my spells came in big chunk through the motivation of me wanting to see if I have in me what it takes to learn and deploy these techniques.\nIt turned out I did. To no one surprise because as we usually do when it comes to most tooling and software in the games industry, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and concepted, created then implemented the techniques. A chorus of ingenious people.\nI\u0026rsquo;m saying this because after all of the descriptions above that might sound incredibly complicated to those of you who have not yet experimented or learnt this type of stuff, you might be left with the misconception that this is incredibly hard to create.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s indeed not as complicated as it sounds. The biggest challenge I faced in learning Houdini was how to actually come up with my initial orb animation. When I did that, the moment I wanted to turn the anim timeline into a VAT and import it into Unreal, I had a bunch of tools already created for us by SideFX.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t need to implement or write any shader. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need to automate any export - import. Those were all already available in Houdini (better yet, they come out of the box with exporters for UE4, UE5 and Unity alike).\nLinks If you are reading this and hoping of trying these type of techniques, either follow the page I linked above (SideFX - VAT for Unreal)\nOr follow these videos, which I followed - VAT 4 | RBD | Unreal and VAT 5 | Fluids | Unreal - though I believe those two are just mirrors of the VAT link above.\nBefore getting into them I suggest watching some general videos of how to manipulate and animate geometry to look like its surface is changing, or even doing some fluid simulation tutorials. After all before you try to turn something into a VAT you want to make sure you have a Houdini animation ready in the first place.\nTo create my orbs I experimented and at the end came up with a pipeline that creates geometrical primitives \u0026ndash; feeds them into Clouds \u0026ndash; feeds into VDB \u0026ndash; then VDB to Polygons. That with recalculated, smoothed normals produces results similar to the Houdini video I embedded under the 6. Animation section of this blog post.\nIf you want to find out how to merge different orbs into an abstract structure, I recommend giving this video a go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hkcRgCgzo\nIt\u0026rsquo;s actually the one I started with. Later on, once I realized I want to try VATs, I winged it and added the \u0026ldquo;convert to clouds then convert to VDB then back to polygons\u0026rdquo; part I described above. I did that because I found that was the easiest way for me to add motion to the otherwise static orbs produced in the tutorial in the sentence above.\nEnvironment Scene After I had made some floating orbs and they were animating nicely inside my UE4 game prototype, of course my Environment Artist side kicked in\u0026hellip;\nI started to think how even though I love using this inside the game prototype, it would be very fun to try and use it inside a polished, set dressed scene.\nI briefly considered just creating a large, circular room inside my game itself. Then set dressing it and polishing it to a vertical slice. As if when you walk inside it you walk into a finished game environment. It wont matter if the entrance or the parts before that were placeholder and checker board.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s around the time I got this story unfolding in my mind:\nAs the chamber shifted around them, their worship remained unmoving.\nCircular, repetitive room. Just a few modular pieces. In the middle there is a shape that changes like fluid, using Houdini and VAT. It has strong emission and perhaps could light the room entirely thanks to that and Lumen? Test it in UE5.\nThe shape will pulse and be animated thanks to the VAT and combination of Niagara curves and wave functions. Next to it will be in circle a number of people.\nThey are on their knees like in a ritual worship.\nThey move up and down their upper torso, while remaining in position, waving hands in the air.\nAt some point the shape \u0026ldquo;glitches\u0026rdquo; into a bunch of triangles (try using a wrong Look Up Table / Textures for the VAT?). As that happens, one of the people is lifted in the air, rotated 180 degrees and then slowly floated into the shape.\nThe shape consumes them.\n― 6 July 2022 When I got that story and jotted down those ideas above on paper, I knew I have to open a new scene and focus entire on that. I put my UE4 game prototype on the side shelf. I opened a new UE5 scene and started blocking out the space. The VAT Houdini orb I made would be the center piece. The jewel in the middle that I spent so much time on and learned so much through.\nEarly Scene Shot With all of the above analyzed and described, we can now dive right into the environment side of things.\nAfter some hours of blocking out and making some initial building wall pieces in Blender, here is what I took the scene to:\nIn the next blog post in this series we will take a look at my initial reference board. We will also see the different modular pieces I made in Blender and how I went about moving them into Zbrush and sculpting having in mind my end result will be used as Nanite meshes.\nI hope you enjoyed this post,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nIf you enjoyed this blog post, consider subscribing in the form below.

It all started a bit before I joined university, when I thought I might write a quick explanation behind the process of how I create my illustrations. That was to go along with some speed painting timelapses I had recorded at the time and put up on YouTube.\nAt university, when I got into learning 3D, I continued that tradition. End of 2018 I joined my first Artstation challenge. Feudal Japan. In there, people were requested, and encouraged to write blog posts about the creation of their works. Those could be short or long, as long as there were plenty of images to show progress in their entry.\nI wondered then, how to approach my posts. Given I had love for writing prior to that, I thought I might be a bit more wordy in some entries. I through I might share my thought process and why I take the decisions I take in the shaping of the 3D spaces.\nI enjoyed that so much that the following year, once I was making my next scene, one that was not for any challenge, I documented its creation in its own blog entries. \u0026ldquo;The Neon Graveyard\u0026rdquo;.\nFollowing all that was the blog entries surrounding the portal, megastructure of \u0026ldquo;The Orbital Gateway\u0026rdquo;.\nShort break followed, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t write as much, as I was moving jobs, from an indie place to where I am working now, as an Environment Artist at Rebellion.\nLast month I decided to get back into it, though. I had spent the past years on and off building a new personal artwork. I thought this might be another cool opportunity to share insights from my creation process with any reader that might be interested into it. Especially given I had been leaning and experimenting heavily with Nanite, Lumen and all kinds of new features in Unreal Engine 5.\nNew Blog Website That\u0026rsquo;s when I started thinking that I would love to have my own platform for my blogs. My own website, my homestead, so to say. In addition, the many entries from my previous years of writings had been all scattered to the winds. Some of my earliest on Tumblr, few then in their own tab and page for an Artstation challenge, then followed by my Artstation blog section on a completely different URL. Then to go away again on yet another unique page. I had written for some websites as a guest too, and I realized some of those are no longer up online.\nA website of my own would be the perfect opportunity to tie all lose ends and put it all in one place, as it should have always been. That is when I started looking into options and considering what would be the best way to create said website. Oh, what a journey that has been. I am no stranger to web design. My creative journey, some 10-12 years ago, when I was a young, curious kid, started with graphics design and web design.\nBack then, I enjoyed and did that for quite a long while. My brother Miroslav Dimitrov helped me, doing coding while I would do graphic design. I grew tired of it (which sounds a bit melodramatic for a kid, but it was the truth). As such I started exploring other creative outlets which lead me straight into 2D art and painting. That was with the idea to one day do concepts and illustrations for video games. All of those countless of hours playing Lineage II and World of Warcraft could not go to waste, after all\u0026hellip;\nFrom 2D to 3D then to breaking into the games industry in late 2019 first as a 3D Generalist / Tech Artist. Then to move to Rebellion in 2021 as an Environment Artist.\nAll of that? To circle back to web design now, in the creation of my own blog space.\nCreating, writing and deploying a website, be it static or more complex is much more pleasant experience now in 2023 than it was back in 2013 when we were fully engaged with that craft, together with my brother. As such I can\u0026rsquo;t say, or take, too much credit for many of the work that goes in here. If you are curious as to how it was created, or want something similar of your own, you can explore the link at the footer of this page. Still I want to put special thanks to Jimmy, who is the original creator of the template I used and revamped to fit my artistic and visual inclinations. I also want to say special thanks to Miroslav, my brother, who helped me figure out and remind myself with the intricacies of web so I could accomplish what I have in this website. I appreciate all of it.\nArchives - Older Blog Entries With this blog going live, forward on I\u0026rsquo;ll be writing new entries about the current projects I have. There is one, I\u0026rsquo;ve code named \u0026ldquo;Shape Ritual\u0026rdquo; where I explore a ruined, circular room with a floating, magical orb in the middle. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to tell you, and show you all about it.\nHowever, you can find all of my previous years of writings and blog entries here too. They are dated to the original time and ported in here identical as they were originally, in the moments I wrote them first. There are no changes a part from a small grammatical or typo fixes here and there. Some of the platforms I initially used to write parts of them also didn\u0026rsquo;t have easy way for adding alt text on images. As such I\u0026rsquo;ve went back and added image descriptions on some pieces that might have initially missed it.\nSome of the entries, I\u0026rsquo;ve updated with new information. Or new thoughts. Or recollections from what I remember I had circling in my mind back then, but left unsaid (or more like unwritten). In those entries, you will see a clear division between what was the original post and what is a newer update. I hope you enjoy those updates as with most of them I\u0026rsquo;ve strived to inform and educate on anything new I\u0026rsquo;ve come to learn since then, improving performance, fixing tech issues or just setting up common good practices for creating 3D art and playable, realtime game scenes.\nSuggested Reading If you are wondering where to begin, I\u0026rsquo;ve got some suggestions for you.\nIf you would like to go into a more chronologically inclined way, you could begin over at \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo;. This link will take you to see the final blog post and as such the final result.\nYou would like to dive from entry one from the series instead? Seeing the look at my early exploration and moodboard gathering? You can do so over at \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine - 01 - Start\u0026rdquo;.\nThis project was created with Unreal 4, Maya, Substance Painter and Designer and if you explore the entries of it, you will find behind the scenes screenshots from those softwares.\nFancy starting the one of the more recent ones? You can give a go to \u0026ldquo;The Orbital Gateway\u0026rdquo;. Like above, this link will take you to the end, final showcase of the project, letting you preview the end result.\nTo teleport yourself right into the very beginning, first entry of the series, you can go over here - \u0026ldquo;The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept\u0026rdquo;.\nIf you happen to be a fan of punk and horror noir, then I\u0026rsquo;ve got just the thing for you. \u0026ldquo;The Neon Graveyard\u0026rdquo; will scratch your cyberpunk itch in a macabre flooded in neon lights.\nTo get to the very first entry, try out this link - \u0026ldquo;The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start\u0026rdquo;.\nI hope you find insight and inspiration in some of those.\nSupport Me For those of you who like to read and observe my art and for those who might have found insight or knowledge and have the resources to consider it, I\u0026rsquo;ve set up a way to support my works. At the bottom of most blog entries you will find a Ko-fi button. It takes right where if you wish you could drop a tip. A coffee, so to say. That support would mean tons to me and would allow me to continue writing and creating the art that you enjoy.\nI strive for my insights and educational pieces to be free of charge. Easy to access by anyone and everywhere. As such if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the means to, don\u0026rsquo;t feel obliged to drop a tip.\nLink to Ko-fi in the blue button below:\nThank you.\nPete.\n","date":"2023-05-27T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/coverLaunch_hua68aa91e790955f08777622113a3da83_879070_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/sitelaunch/","title":"Welcome - Website Launch"},{"content":"Reveal Hey everyone,\nI wanted to quickly share with you something I am immensely excited about.

I hope everyone else had just as much fun and I want to thank all of you who stopped by in this blog for the kind comments and encouragements.\nSpecial thanks to Victor Fritsch for creating the amazing concept piece that this environment is based onto. Make sure to check out his profile and art in the links a bit further below!\nFly-through Video Here is my fly-through showcase video. I tried to make it an interesting one and worked a bit on the sounds too. I hope that you enjoy it.\n(Content warning: there are flashing lights.)\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the main flythrough showcase of The Orbital Gateway.)\nMore Screenshots Some more close up screenshots:\nMy intention was to make the environment visible from multiple angles and have it as much \u0026ldquo;game ready\u0026rdquo; as I could. As such in this backside view I reused some of my assets to try some storytelling and showcase a part of the gateway \u0026amp; stargate that is damaged and malfunctioning.\nCreating this portal effect and experimenting with it has been a really enjoyable process.\nI mixed panning materials with noises and textures fed into normal, fresnels and refractions used onto multiple tori. On top I also placed a particle system I created in Niagara to give even more movement.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\r(Video embedded above. Frontal shot of the active portal.

Starting with callout sheets of the assets and materials:\nThe set of 11 panels above was one of the parts of the project that took me the most time. I tried to created them detailed and interesting while balancing geometry and 2D texture details and hard surface stencils here and there.\nPanels are arced when seen from above and are measured to be modular and snap perfectly when rotated around, forming a cylindrical structure.\nI relied heavily on spline systems reusing the same few base meshes. By the end all spline actors were converted and baked into packets of static geometry so draw calls are minimal and the environment is optimized and runs well.\nTo the left you can see a trim sheet that is used in the background. To the right are hard surface stencil details and decals I modeled in Maya and then baked in Substance Designer in order to distribute across the arced platforms for more detail.\nTimelapse Video I also created this time-lapse video that combines screenshots taken in the process of making the envo in engine.\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing a time-lapse of the making of The Orbital Gateway.)\nLighting is baked.

My main focus has been to polish anything that catches my eye and sticks out. Also to improve my storytelling in any further way I can. I tried to clean up the lights around the portal apertures as well. Lowered the blue leak but increased contrast when you look inside it and see the pipes.\nI also added a second layer of sorts to the portals\u0026rsquo; Niagara VFX I\u0026rsquo;ve been making. It\u0026rsquo;s white and yellow dot particles, spawned on a torus and accelerated to go inwards. Adds just a bit more movement and life.\nNiagara Gif You can see it in this heavily compressed gif here:\nIf you look closely to the very inside and middle of the portal, you can see a radial movement with polar coordinates. I added that yesterday as the previous one I had was just flat pan in U direction on a cap and it looked bit bizarre once you were to take a closer look and notice it.\nMalfunctioning Side I also worked and polished a bit more the side with the malfunctioning portal.\nI added more cables on the platform, improved scale and texture on the existing few and added a \u0026ldquo;parked\u0026rdquo; levitating platform with some metal pieces on it, as if someone were in the middle of repairs. I also scattered few decals here and there to add variety and interest on the platforms that were slightly too pristine before that.\nAnother thing I did yesterday was to add more lit up panels in the background using texture. You can see it in the first picture above. I vertex painted an emission mask with small dots here and there, to go on top of my original trim sheet used on the outer walls.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also been working on my final camera shots and movements for the video. My sequence is mostly done now. I might add few more angles tomorrow, as once I record and go in the video editing software, most of the time I end up slicing and cutting half of the shots away anyway. I also have to take a look into some soundtracks and SFX.\nI hope everyone\u0026rsquo;s final sprint for the challenge is going well, and that it is not too stressful, haha.\nSee you in the next presentation post.\nTake care,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-02-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/orbital012_hu5aaf576d7d3ff060cf2b7762f944494b_394880_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-012/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 12 - Bits and Pieces"},{"content":"Main Screenshot Hey everyone,\nHere is how my scene is looking after some work from the past days.\nI scaled around and made some of the pipes larger. I did that with the idea of filling up the lower and top empty space of the composition better. I also though it will improve the feel of the whole cylindrical portal and make it feel even more immense.\nVapour VFX I then moved onto introducing some smoke and vapor particles. I wanted that in order to give the scene even more life and make it feel bit industrial as well. You can see preview of that below:\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the raising smoke and vapour as seen from the main camera angle of the project.)\nThe smokes are Cascade particle systems that are mostly my own creation. I did however borrow the use of a flipbook (animation sheet) from a 3rd party as it was a bit of a stretch for me to make one from scratch in the little time left. It also would have looked horrible because I have no experience making or baking animations or FX onto singular frames.\nI then moved onto animating some sparks. I also damaged the hull of the inside of the shut off portal and made some aggressive fumes quickly leaving the pipes. See a preview here:\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing another VFX effect. This time around its Niagara sparks that come off some torn sci-fi cables.)\nThose sparks were made from scratch, not in Cascade, but in Niagara instead. If you fancy something similar there are plenty quick tuts out there and results are pretty good.\nPortal VFX I then tried to give more movement to the edges of the portal, especially as seen from profile. I did that again through a Niagara system. I spawn bunch of particles on a torus, have them on moderate lifetime and lower their opacity while apply directional velocity and killing them once they reach certain edge. The effect adds this to the portal:\n(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the portal VFX. Close up camera orbits the portal and shows dark, sci-fi smoke that adds more dimension to the edges where portal VFX meets metal props.)\nCylinder Surface If you look closely on the overall surface of the whole portal, you might notice I also baked and added a lot more hard surface patterns and details. I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to make some of the otherwise empty surfaces even more interesting.\nI think I might do another progress update in the next days, before wrapping up everything in order to submit after that. I\u0026rsquo;ll start a timeline and animate my fly-through cameras, so I might show you some previews of that next. I still need to put in some better poses for the mannequins on the platforms as well.\nThanks a lot for reading.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-02-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/pd-or-11_hubed189c607dce63a90aef860da4cbd11_393976_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-011/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 11 - Smoke and More Stencils"},{"content":"Recolor Quick update with some recoloring and some other details.\nThe original concept had blue tint while my vision of it so far was mostly warm gray. (If you would like a reminder of how the original concept looks, you can find it in blog one of the series). I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to follow the concept word for word, but I could not stop but feel I might be missing out by not trying the colors in it.\nAs such after some experimentation I landed on the colors you see above. I liked those quite a bit more than the original warm tomes I had going on. I then went into trying to clean up the portal / event horizon VFX even more. The previous one was too emissive and noisy for my liking and I though it was too busy.\nHere is another angle:\nYou can also see I cut out the concept of the red, warning like colors. I still want to convey the idea of the gate being partially broken and malfunctioning, but maybe going for red and alarming colors was too obvious and easy. Sure it worked out but I think there are more creative ways to do it, I just have to find them.\nGamut Analysis The gamut is much more limited in colors now and I think the end result is quite more harmonic composition wise. You can see a reading of it in the picture above. I added some cut and exposed wires but I have yet to try adding some sparks and other animated VFX. That might help sell the malfunctioning concept without the use of the red color.\nBaking Normal Details Next I went into making some more pipes for the background. I also made a depth fade shader that gives a force field like effect where some of the pipes go through. Then I went into creating some hard surface stencils and baked details to use and stamp in Substance Painter. I modeled them in Maya and then baked normals of them in Substance Designer. I took those normals to use in Painter. I have just a few going on now but I\u0026rsquo;m going to make more in order to cover some of the otherwise empty areas on the panel surfaces of the portal.\nYou can see it below:\nGif Progression Here is a GIF of my dances with colors:\nLet me know what you think.\nThanks for reading,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-02-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/orbital010_huae59135425536074a541f6edf717555a_416738_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-010/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 10 - Recolored, Depth Fade, Stencils"},{"content":"Lights Hey,\nHere is a quick update.\nI worked on a part of the cylinder in the back that from my previous angles was completely invisible. There was pretty much nothing going on there and I decided to try some storytelling by using some of my existing assets but in a slightly different way. I got the idea that maybe one of the portal gates in the back is malfunctioning. It could have gotten damaged during a spaceship passing. Now the portals\u0026rsquo; event horizon is closed. Red lights indicate of something being wrong. You can see it below.\nI think I might make some cables that are cut and damaged and just hang in there in the red cylindrical part. I could also add some sparks coming out of them. Or gas with visible vapor from some of the wider pipes?\nExtra Angle There are some visible artifacts in the light bakes seen through predominantly black faces on some of the cables. I\u0026rsquo;ll fix that next though. Now that I have this new angle I\u0026rsquo;ll have even more room for movement in the final video, which is always a good thing.\nVFX Improvements I scaled few things here and there but then went onto experimenting in the VFXs a bit more. I wanted to try to add some refraction. I though it might be a nice way to add even more depth and interest in the effects.\nI started by adding just clear refraction on a sphere and then setting that sphere in a position similar to the gates. That produces the distortion that happens on the edge surfaces. A bit like what fire generates on its tip and hottest points. I then liked so much how the refraction turned out that I decided to also revisit my panning main material for the event horizons. In it I was panning just noises and fresnel but this time around I also added refraction.\nAll in all you can see video preview here:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rI also made a Light Function that casts water-like caustics. The function is put on a point light that goes in front of the gates. Adds yet another layer to the VFX. I tried to keep color and opacity of it quite subtle.\nAnother preview:\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rLet me know what you think.\nThanks for reading,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-02-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/orbital009_hub6fb326a66017ddf376bd94c920c7471_381734_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 09 - Red Portal, Refractions"},{"content":"Update Hey everyone. Quick update with a few things in my scene.\nVisually, I spent my attention on mainly two things. First was working on the platforms that the humans sit on. I created a proper mesh to replace the previous placeholder. I also made a material with gradient I can tweak and put colors and noises on top of in order to get that force field effect. I experimented with a few colors for it but ultimately ended up with the one like in the original concept.\nI then moved onto the background once again. I tried to improve the protrusion bits I had placed previously. I wanted the hard surface to look proper and as if part of the room and like weld metal, as opposed to the previous golden supports that looked just like clipped through.\nI also worked more on my trimsheet that I deploy in the background. I added a part to it that has panel-like details and greeble like features. You can see that above.\nOptimization And all of this takes us to today. Tonight I decided to try optimizing the scene a bit. I had spline meshes, non-static parts and materials in the scene that I wanted to improve tech wise. It would not be a successful video at the end, if I were to leave the performance as it were and recorded at 15 FPS. : )\nBefore. Constant at 75-80 ms:\nAfter. Stable at around 18 ms.\nWith some more clean-up and with no stat scenerendering on, I\u0026rsquo;m sitting at a stable 10 ms. Quite better even than the previously mentioned 18 ms. This is not in standalone form so one could argue it might be even better there. I think for recording the video I\u0026rsquo;ll play a timeline through a cooked standalone project and maybe get a bit of a boost in ms from that too.\nMS Comparison All in all I think it will do for now. Here is one final comparison to an ms observation from a week ago to show you how slow it was, lol.\nGif Progress But away from this, and back to visuals. Here is a GIF:\nHope you are doing well.\nThanks for reading,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\nCommentary from 2023 I wanted to quickly mention how exactly I accomplished the big win in performance above. I think anyone with experience can derive and make an educated guess, just by looking at my stat scenerendering profiling pictures above. Yet I write and share these posts with a lot of students too and I wanted to explain it a bit better for them.\nIn the making of this project, I heavily relied on spline blueprints.\nWhen there is a long platform, be it straight geometry or cylindrical motives, instead of placing by hand a repetitive, modular piece, I would feed that piece into a spline blueprint system of my own.\nIt made the art creation process much more quick and powerful.\nThere is one caveat though. When you work with spline blueprints like that you end up leaving all parts as \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo;.\nTo be able to edit a spline curve on the go too, the nodes derive tangent points.\nAll of those pieces stack up in draw calls. When you place one long platform that is a spline blueprint, instead of having say 1 to 5 draw calls you end up with 150-200, because of all of the spline components.\nWhen you put an identical platform spline blueprint copy next to it, that gets its own 150-200 draw calls too. They don\u0026rsquo;t get bundle together with the first one.\nI knew this from the very get go, when I started adding splines. I knew I will need to go back and clean up and \u0026ldquo;bake\u0026rdquo; my geometry into truly static geometry.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Before\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;After\u0026rdquo; screenshots above, you see me doing exactly that. I select my spline blueprints and I use the Unreal 4 Editor integrated\u0026ldquo;Merge Actors\u0026rdquo; function.\nThat turns my one, super long platform (for example) that has 150 draw calls into one piece of geometry, that is say mid-poly, but is 1 draw call.\nI then reuse that super long platform, to the sides, by replacing the rest of the similar blueprints.\nI make sure I don\u0026rsquo;t change the x y z scale of those copied platforms (otherwise the draw calls get separated again, even if not as bad as before).\nDoing even more actions, similar to the above description, I optimized the draw calls in my scene from 1,696.45 to 306.00.\nThat on its own got me from 77 ms (12 fps) to a 10 ms (94 fps).\nUnrelated to the Blueprints or Splines above, but if you are using the Unreal Geometry Brushes to block out spaces, bear in mind they have similar caveat of draw calls.\nEach of those brushes, in its nature to be editable on the go, comes with dozens of draw calls instead of optimized just a few calls.\nI often come across student\u0026rsquo;s block out projects that run at bare minimum FPS. They often ask and wonder why that happens and most often my advise is either to bake down all of their Geometry Brushes to truly static, non editable geometry, or to start blocking out using primitive Static Meshes.\nHave fun in Unreal!\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-02-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/orbital008_hua8a47604cc6e7558410de43db911683f_377526_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 08 - Platforms, Background, Optimisation"},{"content":"Different Lighting I\u0026rsquo;m back for an update with a different lighting and some portal VFX.\nIn the scene from last time, most lights were overlapping and causing quite a few baking issues. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to leave them to Movable and as such dynamic instead of Static. Mainly because I want the scene to run well in real time so I can record a video at the end.\nThen there was the fact that my previous version was arguably making the whole greeble details very flat. As such I decided to completely revamp the lights. I\u0026rsquo;m happy with them now and performance is much better although I might brighten it up a bit more here and there with any future progress as I don\u0026rsquo;t want the scene too dark.\nAfter doing the relighting I decide to have some fun with the portal effect itself. I also really disliked the fact it was completely white and empty as in my opinion it was breaking the picture a bit.\nVFX Video Showcase Your browser does not support the video tag.\rI did a custom shader that utilizes few Perlin, Clouds and Plasma noises exported from Designer. Few of those are b\u0026amp;w greyscale masks, but a few I also exported as converted Normal maps with crazy high intensity. The Normals I unpacked from Tangent to World space and I then feed into a Fresnel function. I exposed few parameters for tint, color, emission, fresnel power, fresnel emission and custom opacity control that lerps the b\u0026amp;w noises together.\nThe material I slapped onto a torus. It\u0026rsquo;s cut in half and some of the faces are prolonged. UVs on it are straightened and then when I put the material on it together with a UV panner I get the effect as if energy is moving inwards.\nThe end result that you see in the video above is just three tori, varying on size, overlapping one another, with three instances of the material graph that have slight variance in color, emission and panner direction.\nIn there you can see through the transparent bits of the portal some pipes and metal elements. I thought it would be cool if you could peek and it was not completely opaque.\nAnd here is me going bonkers with a spline and Duplicate Special set to instance in Maya.\nIt was lots of fun and I recommend trying it if you ever do circular designs and your package of choice is Maya.\nMore Screenshots You can probably notice I did some work on the background too. I started blocking out some rooms and primitive details just today and I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing more of that tomorrow. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to soon start bringing the background to a good level of detail when compared to the foreground.\nGif GIF of the progress. You can see me struggle with the lighting.\nI hope you enjoy what you are seeing.\nThanks for reading,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-01-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/orbital007_huf01c8940e37e3aa071e48896400a6763_356806_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-007/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 07 - Relit Scene, VFX"},{"content":"Texturing Hey everyone.

Here is some progress on the things I\u0026rsquo;ve been making the past days.\nAs usual I spent even more time on the greebles and putting more detail on them. I made one or two new greeble panels and I am up to nearly 9 of them in total now. Two of which still have a few empty corners. I also struggled to reuse them in one or two places specifically, where no matter which one I put it became obvious there is repetition. So I think I\u0026rsquo;ll just make a final extra one before calling their number be set.\nSculpt I had some experiments with some details around the portal entrance itself too. I made an aperture-like piece that has sharp, fangs-like appearance. But before that I also made a sculpt of a face. It\u0026rsquo;s eyes are covered by cables.\nI sculpted it in Zbrush. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have that much detail but arguably it\u0026rsquo;s not really needed for it to have any as it\u0026rsquo;s just a detail piece mounted above and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really need to be a centrepiece.\nGif Progress gif:\nThe fang bits have placehold gold material although I think I might keep a type of gold by the end too. On some of the greebles and most of the portal I will try some light and silver metals and as such I really want to try to contrast some gold pieces and details here and there too. For a renaissance or art deco in outer space kind of a style.\nWhenever I start the materials and textures I\u0026rsquo;ll also tint everything towards more blue most likely.\nI always forget to mention this, but I am thinking of later on having a go at some VFX and interesting visuals for the portal plane itself.

I\u0026rsquo;m back with an update.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been slowly building up more detail. There is still quite a bit of empty surface area but I\u0026rsquo;ll be tackling that the next days. I spent 2 days doing just cables and greeble details and it was quite exhausting at some point.\nAs such today I took a break from that and worked on the overall picture, atmosphere and lightning. It\u0026rsquo;s not final but at least now I covered the big hole on the ceiling that I had in the placeholders. I had Directional Light coming from there and once I got rid of that everything went quite dark and I had to build it up bit by bit.\nUpper Parts It was good fun and I finally got to do some pipes on the upper part of the Stargate portal too. It was empty before but you could not see it because of the limited camera angle. I intend to have video with movement at the end and different FOV and as such I had to put detail up there too, I could not just ignore it.\nGif GIF progress animation:\nI had an interesting challenge with the Volumetric Fog. Once I closed off the ceiling and removed the Directional Light, the Volumetric Fog turned pitch black-like. You can see it in one of the steps above, though in movement\u0026hellip; oh boy\u0026hellip; it was much worse looking when flying around. I had to tweak a bit but ended up with result I quite like. I did not want to give up on Volumetrics and disable them because that removes my eerier blue glow I so much want.\nStill haven\u0026rsquo;t tried any materials, textures or colors. I am purposefully keeping myself away from that for now though. I think there will be plenty of time for that once I have all of the geometry and shapes and silhouettes in.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been building it up slowly with cables, fuse boxes and other details. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to increase the variety and fidelity even more once I block out the basic shapes on the faces that are still empty.\nGif Here is a gif of things in action:\nI knew I should approach the details on the cylinder as if they were greebles back when I picked the concept. I was worried that might make them look very squarish and nearly committed to just doing freehand placed geometry. I was having lunch next and I could not stop thinking that not trying more modular approach might be a mistake. I also had the imagine of this old puzzle toy my grandparents used to keep in their house back at home in Bulgaria when I was a kid. I could not get it out of my head. So I went back, took measurements and split the circumference of the cyl into few even pieces. I then started putting details on top of those pieces.\nThe toy I mentioned is seen in the middle. (Googling an obscure, long word descriptions of it gave me a result saying \u0026ldquo;old Soviet puzzle toy\u0026rdquo;. Brilliant.)\nEnd result is a bit more modular and structured than just placing random bits here and there. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to produce a small library of 7-8 of these \u0026ldquo;arched panels\u0026rdquo;. Then I\u0026rsquo;ll build the whole structure through just them. I also decided I\u0026rsquo;ll probably not constrain myself perfectly into some of the panels so there is better feel of flow and it looks less forced into rectangles later on.\nIn the future, somewhere by the end I could also produce few pieces of cables and other details that serve literally as foliage (but are not plants, lol) and are scattered in engine to give even more detail.\nCables Yes, making cables and wires was fun, why would you ask? Smile. Jokes a part the first few are kind of fiddly but then you build a small library of few curves and finished wires and you can easily knock out new ones through Soft Selection (in Maya).\nI know they look very high poly right now, but I am keeping their back faces and proper edge loops for easy iteration. Once I start finishing the panels though, all back sides that are not seen are getting deleted, lots of the edge loops that don\u0026rsquo;t add that much flow will go as well.

Here is some progress from the past 3 days.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been mainly blocking out the space and making sure the scale and placement is correct. Not many details yet, but there will be time for that later on.\nFirst thing I did the other day when I started was to block out some rough shapes directly in Unreal using the basic Brushes. Instead of dragging the shapes around, I used the settings tab and put in specific values for the size of each thing. What I had at the end of that day was pretty meh visually, but it was important that I had some numbers and measurements figured out.\nThe next day, I went in Maya where I started the proper geometry, again using the values I had picked in the Brushes. After making few of my static meshes, I put them into Unreal with a gray, placeholder materials. I then experimented a bit more with fog and light and had a scene that looked a bit better.\nProgress Gif I\u0026rsquo;ll keep my tradition I started back a few challenges ago (with the Feudal Japan one) and export some progress GIFs and animations in some of my blog updates. Here is one:\nToday I mainly created some of the shapes on the cylindrical room, as seen in the background.\nSplines The pipes, by the way, are made by a small cut section of a mesh I modeled in Maya that was then used in a custom Spline tool I created in Unreal. That enabled me to easily create all of the different shaped pipes you see. I need to bake them into proper geometry later on, as they are just non static Blueprints right now and that will cause issues with lighting later on when I start baking lights, but for now though, it will do.\nI hope everyone else is having fun with their scenes.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-01-09T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/orbital001_huee5b5b7f95c095ced602ae8621017872_206655_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-002/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 02 - Blockout and Splines"},{"content":"Start Hey guys,\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a while since I took a part in the challenges here (this project was part of Game Environment/Level Art Artstation Challenge 2021. That is what I was referring to here back when I initially wrote this.).\nI am very excited and can\u0026rsquo;t wait to start the gray boxing.\nBefore that, here is the concept I chose to go with. I fell in love the moment I saw it and I think it fits very well what I usually go for visually.\nMain Concept Art The work is called Stargate Orbital Station and its a concept by Victor Fritsch. Thanks for the lovely artwork, Victor!\nAnother reason I decided to go with this one is because I think it would be an interesting practice in hard surface and machine and pipe-like details. I want to push my hard surface skills so I though it\u0026rsquo;s ideal.\nMoodboard Here is my larger reference sheet. (I\u0026rsquo;ll be adding to it later on)\nThe centrepiece is of course Victor Fritsch but I also included a few other ideas and thoughts I have for my plan for the project.\nFirst off, I included H.R Giger because I think it would be an interesting challenge to try to mimic some of the type of organic, but at the same time industrial feel he creates in his works. I also love the thought of the white silver/chrome, metallic look and I think I might try that for the surfaces in the project.\nFrom other challengers I included a piece by Alex Mordovets as I want to later on try to have some kind of a visual effect inside the portal gate. Alexs\u0026rsquo; piece has a black hole as the focal point and I though that is an interesting idea.\nAnother artist I included, that I came across on here on Artstation is Alec Tucker with his Viscera project. His work is very masterful and I love the gritty, film grain look in the final piece. I will try to have my artwork tid bit brighter but I think there is lots I can learn by Alec as long as I keep an eye on his piece whilst I work on this one.\nThanks for reading.\nGood luck to everyone,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/VictorFritsch_hua74c7c4225654ddbe82490a8dc61455f_539433_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-001/","title":"The Orbital Gateway - 01 - Reference / Concept"},{"content":"Main Camera As some of you might have seen through my portfolio, The Neon Graveyard is finally finished.\nFinal Post I wanted to make this one final post, to wrap up the last eight entries of the series.

That is, looking at the atmosphere, at least. The layout is more or less the same.\nMist I had this idea, of having mist just above the surface, since the very start. I purposely postponed it until now, though, as I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to get crazy with tweaking volumetric fog settings, alpha and fog cards and putting crazy amount of time in it, whilst not having the basic layout figured out or any of the props ready. But now, when nearly all of the props are ready, I had the time to sit down and work on vapor and smog.\nFor anyone wanting to recreate this, the ground mist is just a very large Particle Emitter. Its tied up to a Clouds texture, pans a tiny bit, has a pretty short lifespan and is spawn cylindrical. After that its just a matter of tweaking your Volumetric Fog settings in your Exponential Height Fog volume. I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure the guy in Epics video (14th minute mark) about Volumetric Fog in the Engine quickly recreates something very similar. The only part I added myself, is how I placed it in the world. It\u0026rsquo;s just below the surface of my Landscape. And that\u0026rsquo;s how I made it look like ground mist.\nStained Glass Another, very important addition since last time, is the Stained Glass material that I created. It\u0026rsquo;s made from scratct in Substance Designer. What you see here is version 2.0, as the first one I created, I abandoned after a bit, as I though its shape was too simple. It had a diamond pattern going for it, and I wanted something more intricate looking than that.\nMy main approach to it was creating a base pattern and then picking up different areas of it and applying a few individual Flood Fills. Each Flood Fill is turned to Color and then the hue, saturation and lightness of each shape that the Fill has picked up is randomised. The tricky part was giving it a shining look afterwards, in the Engine. If you look at just the material \u0026ldquo;ball\u0026rdquo; in Substance, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like much on its own. To give it that emissive look, I masked just a small portion of the whole patter. I applied another Flood Fill (by now third) and gave it sharp, stained masked noise with a Slope Blur.\nI\u0026rsquo;m particularly happy with this approach, and it gave me one thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t anticipate and wasn\u0026rsquo;t aiming to achieve. If you look at the texture up close in Unreal (the screenshot above), the emission mask is distinct and clear (white magenta bits). As you start going further away from it, though, the Engine shrinks the texture quality a bit, which blurs the emissive pixels. Those pixels then, start to work together with the Bloom settings of the scene, and fill the whole glass surface with a dark, electric, blue color.\n(As I described, you can feed an outline of your pattern towards a Flood Fill. You can then use a Flood Fill To Color to randomise the HSL of each generated shape. You can see all of that in the screenshot above.)\nIf you are making a strained texture of your own, I would suggest experimenting with emissive mask, but also pay attention to your Bloom settings in the Post Processing Volume. A good combination of both, always makes for exciting results.\nFor the pattern of the texture, I was in parts inspired by Matthias Schmidt\u0026rsquo;s techniques, which he shares over in his blog. Check that out too.\nOther Things Most things are ready by now. I still have a few objects to put textures to. The boxes that you can still see are placeholder for hopefully some statues of something looking like a weeping angel. I want one or two of those, to contrast the very straight shapes of the rest of the headstones.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also still working on the details of the main gate that you can see in the very first shot in this post. Facade details around the big window too.\nMaking this project has been quite a fun journey. I think this will be my last post about it though. As long as it goes about approach explanation at least. My next one \u0026lsquo;hopefully\u0026rsquo; will be a gallery to showcase the final result. I\u0026rsquo;ll be working on the video, to showcase the casket as well.\n(Casket as seen from a few posts ago, as I have a feeling some of you probably don\u0026rsquo;t even remember it. It\u0026rsquo;s still here! Going to animate it for a final video.)\nOne of the reasons I started this project a few months ago, is my university. As such I\u0026rsquo;ll be submitting it as a thesis in about a week now. So that\u0026rsquo;s the deadline by which you will hopefully see the final result as well.\nProgress GIF (Some of you know I\u0026rsquo;m a fan of progress GIFs, so here is a very compressed final one.)\nThanks.\nTo those of you who you stuck with me through the whole journey, and read all of the previous entries (about eight), I want to say thanks.

The other thing is refining textures and figuring out how exactly I\u0026rsquo;m going to tackle making the neon signs. Previously, my neons were just simple alpha cards with an emissive text. Although in its core that\u0026rsquo;s what neon signs look like anyway, I wanted to put more attention and detail into them than just that. Possibly build a more complex material shader.\nAs the last two posts were about the casket, it\u0026rsquo;s been a very long while since we\u0026rsquo;ve last seen the scene as a whole. As such I am just going to show you at what stage I am right now, and then we can talk about how I created the different bits.\nThe Scene And just as a reminder - this was we had before (three weeks ago or so):\nNeon Signs From close up, this is how the \u0026ldquo;Personal Eternity\u0026rdquo; sign looks like:\nAnd a few GIFs to show the animations I\u0026rsquo;ve put in the signs. (gifs are heavily compressed as Artstation caps the file size at a very low amount).\nI intend to make some even more dynamic, by having letters flick. The metal mounts of each sign still lack textures, but that will be for later.\nThe text that\u0026rsquo;s lit up is in Russian and reads the same way as the English one next to it \u0026ldquo;Backup your Consciousness\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a play on words as well, which I will animate for the final video. The idea I have in mind with that is about the text in Russian, appearing lit up fully at first - \u0026ldquo;Сохраняйте свое сознание\u0026rdquo;. The whole sign then flicks on and off a few times, as if short on electricity. When it powers up again, its left with just \u0026ldquo;охраняй сознание\u0026rdquo;. First and last two letters from the first word are off, second word is entirely off. And what we are left with reads from \u0026ldquo;Backup your\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Guard your Consciousness\u0026rdquo;.\nMaking the Signs At some point, I made the alpha cards of the neons into 3D objects. I made a few of the texts into actual geometry, but then when I inserted them in, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t really tell from afar that they are dimensional and 3D. Going up close to them, most still looked relatively the same - flat. That\u0026rsquo;s why I decided that there is no really point into turning them into expensive on memory 3D.\nPlain text with an emissive material was flat as well, and as such I went into trying to figure out another way to make them look better, more dimensional, and more neon-ish. That\u0026rsquo;s when I though of trying a transparent text with a border. I then put a second border to that said border. The inner border, I assigned bright color together with emission. The outer border, I left dark. The fact that they are transparent from the inside, boosted the illusion of \u0026ldquo;neon\u0026rdquo;. What I discovered then, is a trick I made up which turned them actually dimensional (sadly probably not very well seen in the GIFs due the small image size). I duplicated the text as it is in the world in the engine. I then offset its position by a few pixels backwards from the original position. To that second copy, I then applied an instance of the original material. In that instance, I can change the previously exposed parameters such as the colors of the inner and outer borders, as well as emission level of the glow. Then, by changing those colors, to ones completely different from the original, I managed to create an illusion of depth. The result is best seen when you move the camera while looking at the signs from a side. The secondary colors, from the text copy that is behind, leak and bloom softly. They contrast so well with the front text, that whilst you move, they make the whole text appear as if an actual neon, with dimension and shifts in the value and hue of its color. That effect is apparent even from the static shot seen above, that showcases the \u0026ldquo;Personal Eternity\u0026rdquo; neon.\nThe borders, I created in Photoshop using Blending Options - Stroke. To keep everything optimised, I suggest making those masks into a single image. In the image above, I\u0026rsquo;ve put the two different borders, onto two channels - one on Green, the other on Blue. In the material shader, I simply take those channels and assign them color and emission value.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve showed you how I do this with a single text - \u0026ldquo;Personal Eternity\u0026rdquo; taking a whole bitmap of 512x512, but for this project, I actually keep every text and neon design, into one single image. In a 2k texture, you can fit much more than you would think, and using every channel - R, G and B - allows for even more effects and optimisation.\nHeadstones and Other Props In Zbrush, I imported low-poly models of headstones that I created in Maya. I turn them high-poly by dividing the geometry with smooth off. I then sculpt detail on that and when I am happy with the result, I create a new, low-poly version, by decimating the topology. For that, I use Decimation Master, that can be found in Zbrush.\nThe headstone seen below, I decimated from 2.3m tris to 2k using Decimation Master. When you go to poly that low, you can freely take the model in Maya, and UV map it by hand. 2k tris is not too much, and as such the automatic mapping in the newer versions of Maya does quite a good job. It takes most of the flat surfaces and gives you whole UV islands, and it leaves just a few weird triangles here and there, that you can quickly sew back in place. Small edges with lots of damage on them, usually get mapped weirdly too, but you can go over those and fix them with relative ease.\nLater on, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of giving the weird letters on the headstones, actual metal mounts and have some cables run towards them from the ground. Right now they sort of give the vibe of magical runes.\nOther Things For the landscape I\u0026rsquo;ve scattered some detail using small rocks, broken pavement as well as some cables. I\u0026rsquo;ve created the cables as a spline system, and although it took a bit of time to place as many copies as I\u0026rsquo;ve done, it was very fun to do. Obviously, I tried having them glowing at first, but decided against it as it was getting a bit too much in the way. Their texture might still need some more work though.\nThe cathedral in the distance will still need some more attention. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of some decals and props to scatter and give variety and detail both to the roof and to the walls. The windows will have stained glass material to them, with an emissive mask. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to achieve some electrical whimsical colors, to fit the Cyberpunk vibe. I\u0026rsquo;ve left them for this late on, as I already have plans on how to create them in Substance Designer. Working on materials like that is probably one of the things I enjoy most in 3D, and frankly said, that\u0026rsquo;s why I am keeping them as a treat to myself after I get the rest of the important things done.\nHope you found this post insightful and interesting. Until next time,\nPete.\nP.S. My abilities in the Russian language, are limited to the few lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve had years ago, back at home in Bulgaria. As such I want to thank Alexey Shiyan for double checking my signs, and assuring me, that my whole idea behind the play on words, actually works. : )\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/cover007_hu8a7aac6f66f7608bc80efda8e549ca38_399035_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs"},{"content":"Last time I showed you a just completed as far as it goes in terms of geometry prop. The weeks after that I\u0026rsquo;ve spent on creating materials for it and actually texturing it. I\u0026rsquo;ve done a few changes on the overall scene as a whole too, but this post will be once again mostly about the \u0026ldquo;Cyberpunk Casket\u0026rdquo;.\nThe Casket in Unreal It\u0026rsquo;s been a slow process as I\u0026rsquo;ve been making everything from scratch. I\u0026rsquo;ve been building up my own \u0026ldquo;library\u0026rdquo; of materials as well as alpha masks for shapes like the writings, protrusions, retrusions, labels and more decals of such style.\nWhen I build scenes in Unreal, they rarely consist of props made to be scrutinised from very up close. I knew from a long time, though, that I want this model to be the focal point of my showcase video. I want to tell a story of sorts, and this prop will be my main actor. That is why I\u0026rsquo;ve went quite higher in detail (both in geometry and texture density) than I usually do.\nRight now, the prop sits at a bit less than 17k of geometry. I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy about that fact, as I though it would be much more costly. The fan piece is understandably expensive (500-600 tris), but its instanced and as such is loaded into the memory only once. I call it into a custom Blueprint to animate it so it spins around.\nAnother Gif: The screenshots you see are from Unreal. There, I\u0026rsquo;ve made my own light set-up, which is still not final, but is getting there.\nMaterials Here are previews of a few of the materials I created for this prop. Some are actual final materials with full bitmaps channels for PBR, but a few are just patterns I created and then used in Painter to blend more normal and height detail into the prop (an example would be the dotted pattern).\nFirst material is the one I used the most. Its a plastic with a simple anisotropic noise to give it a better feel. Taking it into Painter, I\u0026rsquo;ve duplicated it, changed its color to lighter, changed the direction of the anisotropic filter and I\u0026rsquo;ve put a smart mask on it. The result is not seen here, but can be seen further up, in the first screenshots. I\u0026rsquo;ve build up the fan material like that. Second is a triangular pattern I used to give some visual noise. Most of the time it might not be noticed as I\u0026rsquo;ve put it to around 20-30% opacity. Just enough to build up some interest. Dots are what you see on the servers, and the last one is electrical tape for the cables.\nIray renders Here are some screenshots from renders I ran in Painter. Bit fizzy here and there and with quite a few white pixel artifacts, but this will do for now. I will make better passes at the end.\nTell me how you find it so far.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/cover006_hu2ccd4a4d553306081b287ab5f6b362b5_450544_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 06 - Textured Casket"},{"content":"Main Camera Shot The view from the main camera. Started putting the brick textures from the last post in. Also created a metal trim to go on the mausoleums roofs.\nCyberpunk Gravestones The more interesting part though, is that I started development on the gravestones.\nMy idea from the very start of the project, was to create a spacious environment and then showcase it in some interesting video with nice camera movements and maybe even some basic animations. While working on the layout and general mood, I was thinking all the time on what I want to do with the gravestones themselves. I knew I wanted to turn them in some weird, cyberpunk devices that serve a purpose.\nAt first look they appear ordinary (apart from the neon signs, and the disc looking device) but upon close inspection you see there is something that might be going on with them.\nThe Concept The holes of the gravestones will look like any ordinary ones. The camera zooms into one though and some movements starts. The entire hole, in which a casket would go, starts moving up. Pressure release sounds plays and some vapour particle systems triggers. With the upward movement we suddenly see the side of the \u0026ldquo;coffin\u0026rdquo; and realise that there is something weird to it. Lots of wires run through it, connecting cooling systems and servers together. Lots of small lights flick on and off.\nThe middle prolonged shapes (seen in the picture above), I want to give the look of as if they are storage space (digital ones, of course). Hopefully I will find a nice way to wire up the gravestones with some cables that go towards the cathedral itself. If that is visible from the main camera, the viewer could have a hint towards those gravestones way before the camera zooms in and the whole sequence I described plays.\nAt the very front of the \u0026ldquo;casket\u0026rdquo; I put a terminal. Going to have some fun animating the screen with some weird numbers and code showing later on. Also, texturing that keyboard should be quite interesting too.\nI want to have this whole prop be quite more detailed in both geometry and texture, compared to what I ordinary do. In a way that its obvious that its a prop, meant to be inspected from very up close in a first person game. I\u0026rsquo;ll still do my best with optimisation too, nothing is going to be too crazy (the spinning fans, which are the most heavy on geometry objects, would be an instance of a single object, and I will animate them to spin in the sockets).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve UV mapped a big chunk of it already and I hope to have some interesting stuff to show next time. In the meantime, tell me what you think of the idea and the general look of this \u0026ldquo;casket\u0026rdquo; so far. Hoping to bring it to life with lots of cyberpunky lights and wires.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-03-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-005/cover005_huebf92f2e97efc44066c15823deaef3ac_322432_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-005/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 05 - Cyberpunk Caskets"},{"content":"\nIn the last post we mentioned the most important Blueprints we need in order to have actual gameplay. They do build the win/lose condition, but we still need one more very important element.\nWe need what I call right now, and am going to refer to, with the word “blocks”. The blocks are the pieces that go on the environment to cast shadows here and there. The blocks are what the player is in control of, as I said way back in the first post.\nTetris Pieces In the game, I have tiles, that put together create the map/surface area. Then, on top of those, go the blocks. They fit together perfectly in slots, as I need it to be visually explicit where a player is allowed to place and where they are not.\nFirst “sketch” of the shapes I did in Maya. It was a quick test to see what shape could work the best. At that point in my mind I already knew I wanted one shape repeated many times like a tile, but I still was not certain what that shape would be.\nBefore I did anything, I had a quick sketch, that does not look very impressive, that I made in Photoshop. It was more of a guide for the mood, that was assuring me I am going in the direction I want to.\nYou could probably see that the image I produced above, was what inspired me to go towards a blue starry sky, overall dark tone, and a very bright sun.\nYou can also sort of see the path, illustrated in blue, and the idea of going from point A to point B as a main objective in the game.\nSun After I had figured out the visual of the tiles, and the Sun next to them, the first draft was a hollow, holographic looking star. Although I said I don’t have plenty of time to create textures and shaders (thus the tiles are textureless) I still needed to make sure the Sun has a texture. The Sun needs one, because it is a main game mechanic element. We need to be able to tell, visually, that it’s big, that it’s hot, and that it is potentially dangerous. It can’t simply be hollow. That is when I went into making a texture and some basic animation for it.\nMy reference sheet (or what others call a mood board) for the Sun. You can see the giant Sun from Destiny 2 on a few different screenshots.\nThe final visuals of the sun.\nThe Sun is created from two spheres that go inside each one. The outer one is a low poly, with a Fresnel Shader applied to it. It gives it the triangular holographic look, that flickers with a subtle animation. Inside of it is a proper texture, unlit Shader, that has an animated normal and some glow too. Both materials can be controlled for a change in color.\nDifferent colors of the stars.\nSome levels of the game could have multiple suns different locations. In that case I can have selection of colors so each is unique, more interesting.\nBack to the Block Pieces What those needed was a “placement system” Blueprint. It was good that I knew exactly how I wanted that. That’s, again, thanks to the traditional RTS games. What I ended up making is simple in words, but more complex in Blueprints. It’s a system where you can click on a block to place it, it becomes semi-transparent and red (again with the help of a Fresnel function). If you point to a tile, that is marked with a Boolean that says “True” for “Is this tile Place-able on?”, then the transparent color turns green. It also lets you place it on top if you click.\nThe system for that is quite complex and I genuinely would have to do a few posts to find a way to explain it like a tutorial. Something, for which sadly there is no time right now.\nI also have to thank my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, who is a programmer and helped me figure out the logic of a few things I needed to do, so I could properly turn them into Blueprints. I am sure he did not find it as amusing and fun as I did, mainly because he writes in code, has no idea how Blueprints work, and had to just guide me and watch me struggle on my own with Unreal.\nMy guide for anyone that might want to make a system like that is to look into Get Hit Result Under Cursor by Channel. That is basically a line trace that goes where the location of the mouse cursor is. After you use that, do a check to what object the mouse is pointing at, and then have your IFs to change color, check if placement is possible and et cetera.\nPointing the mouse at valid slot tiles makes the block green. Red for not being able to place.\nBlocks Visuals Here I want to mention, that given the blocks are so important and the player interacts with them, it would make sense to have textures and proper interesting models for them. I would love to do that, but for now just a different color will have to do. I will go back to it and maybe model out something, given that after I completed all of the important Blueprints I need, and I make a few playable levels, I am left with some free time.\nMy research on how the blocks could potentially look just randomly walked through my door one day. Or more like not my door, but the door of the university building I am in during classes.\nBeautiful statues, courtesy of Cheryl Vollor.\nThose intricate ceramic statues, painted with acrylic on top (if I remember correctly) are created by Cheryl Vollor. I met her randomly in the first showcase room here at UCLAN in Preston. To get to the studio of our class, you walk through an entrance, small “hall” of sorts, where every week different art displays are put on. That’s where Cheryl had the exhibit of her statues.\nThe moment I first saw them, I suddenly imagined some of the maps of my game to be like that. A weird, alien environment, with peculiar crystal formations and colorful blocks that are in a juxtaposition with the dull monotone colors of the surface. The player could pick up those blocks and move them around. This whole thought came to me way before I had done any prototyping and it just sparkled a lot of excitement in me.\nI spoke to Cheryl, who was amazing, and let me use the visuals of her statues in any game I created or for any research I would need. Thanks again for that, Cheryl!\nAnother photo of the statues. By Cheryl Vollor.\nBut as I said, we will sadly have to wait to see if I get some free time to “upgrade” the visuals of my blocks with anything remotely similar to those pictures.\nHopefully you found this visual research intriguing. Next we will look into the first playtest with actual living people, that my game saw! Woah!\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nUpdate from 2023 I wanted to quickly update this entry to mention that there was no \u0026ldquo;next time\u0026rdquo;. I wrapped up the project by adding a few extra levels and having it all then playable.\nI will admit to you though, that the game prototype was behind, priority wise, on the list of my other works, given I had at the time focused on crafting an Environment Art portfolio to try and find my break into the industry later that same 2019.\nAs such I put most of my attention in \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The Neon Graveyard\u0026rdquo; (both of which you can read in detail about by using the \u0026ldquo;Category\u0026rdquo; buttons to the right whilst on the main page of this blog).\nI did, however, create a \u0026ldquo;trailer\u0026rdquo; for the game, as part of the course. I never got to writing another entry to these blogs and showing it there, but here it is for you:\nGame Trailer No mention of \u0026ldquo;vampires in space\u0026rdquo;. Kind of a missed opportunity, 2019 Peter! Instead just \u0026ldquo;Astronauts\u0026rdquo;? Oh well\u0026hellip;\nYou can see in the trailer that I tried to keep it humorous and easy going, as I thought then, and still believe that would be the right course of action for the game.\nThanks,\nPete.\n","date":"2019-02-24T18:19:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromo03_hu4fa52918670842e7181bfb7bbc0b0a97_295386_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/","title":"Chromosphere 03 - Visuals"},{"content":"\nScreenshots showcasing the path with the unit (astronaut) on it. There are red ground textures in this one, but I stepped back and returned to a more clear visual style late, mainly because I wont have much time to work on visuals. Its all about Blueprints and game mechanics.\nImportant Blueprints For this to become a playable game, I need three crucial elements.\nOne:\nOne is the camera. Unreal Engine 4 does start with a few presents of options for camera. You can have first- or third-person instantly set up with proper Blueprints. In this case, though, I need a system for a camera that is more close to the properties of one in an RTS game. I want the player to see everything from above, at a sort of isometric view. That preset does not exists and sadly I will have to build my own, from scratch.\nTwo:\nTwo is the path, on which the player unit is going to walk. The player themself are not exactly that unit, they are not the astronaut. They don\u0026rsquo;t control the astronaut. At least not in the sense where the player moves them around with inputs like arrow or WASD keys. Instead, on the screen UI there is a button. It says “Walk”. The player presses that and the Astronaut starts walking along the path.\nThe Walk button as seen in the game, next to the Health Pool display.\nThree:\nThree is a Sun blueprint. In it would be stored the information of when the player should take damage. In this case, I’ve created a array of elements. I reference those and then cast a line trace between those elements (in this case, they are spotlights) and the Astronaut. If in-between those there is any element blocking the trace, then I can come to a conclusion that the Astronaut must be in shadow, and thus should take no damage.\nHaving said all of this, lets look at each one individually once more, but this time more in detail when it comes to the logic and the blueprints themselves.\nCamera I’ve created my own Pawn blueprint. In it I’ve placed a camera that moves together with the movement of a ball. The ball is set to be invisible, with no collision and through the Blueprints I move the ball around. The camera follows it and thus becomes functional.\nThere are four ways to control that movement. Three are quite simple and the 4th is a bit more complicated. First and second are controls through the arrow keys of the keyboard and through WASD. I’ve mapped those to axis movement input in the Project Settings, and then I’ve called those keybindings in the blueprints.\nThird way of movement is panning. You click right mouse button with the cursor of the mouse anywhere on the screen and you drag around - the map drags with the movement.\nFourth was the most complicated one. It’s just like the one in a traditional real-time strategy game. You point the mouse at the edges of the screen and the camera moves in that direction.\nTo get that working, I am calling a function in the Blueprints that is there by default. It is called Get Mouse Position on Viewport. See, the screen is composed out of numbers. Sort of mapped in X and Y coordinates. Just like the illustration I’ve included above. The functions returns those X and Y and I check their value. I create 4 cases, sort of mapping the screen in 4 sectors. Or 5 I presume. One is the very middle where nothing happens. The 4 important sectors are those in the edges. If X and Y correspond to numbers that are in those 4 sectors, I then know the mouse is there and next I move it in the correct direction.\nA view of the blueprint.\nImages hosted here are for some reason tiny, and I know that you probably wont be able to see very well each individual node. But I believe you can follow the logic following the colors of the links.\n(Edit: this was initially hosted in another web where images are smaller. One above is bigger, yet I know its actually still not easy to follow what is seen, so I apologize for not having a higher resolution for you.)\nEverything goes in, running on an Event Tick. After all, I need to check where the mouse is all the time. Going in, it then plays a Sequence hooked up to 4 IFs (branches). You can already guess, that those 4 ifs control the test where the mouse is. In a case an if branch is true, it sets a value of 2 Float variables I’ve created. XDir and YDir. I set those two to -1 or 1. And with their respectable combination, it yells 4 results to where the mouse could be.\nI don’t have enough time to take screenshots of each node and showcase it well. Or to explain the logic node by node. As this is not really a detailed tutorial. But I do hope talking about the logic behind this blueprint served to be of some help to anyone reading.\nWalkable path The spline system seen in the Engine. The visuals are outdated and the shaders I am using look kind of weird. Still you can see the system demonstrated.\nIf you want a similar spline system set up, you can follow this. Mine is identical, with the difference that I’ve also included a player mesh that moves on top of it (Astronaut).\nThe important part about this system is the fact that the spline, with its points that I can add, remove and move around dynamically, allows me the freedom to set up multiple levels. It’s like a sandbox system ready to be used.\nSun Blueprints Invisible line traces are cast all the time to detect collision. In this image, I’ve made them visible for illustration purposes.\nLine traces are cast from a function called Line Trace by Channel. Its pretty straightforward to use and I am sure you can find plenty of resources about it. Its \u0026ldquo;Start\u0026rdquo; is Sun, and the \u0026ldquo;End\u0026rdquo; is the Astronaut BP Actor (the mannequin). Small tweak I’ve done is that the start is not just the Sun, but its an array of Spotlight Elements. That way I can place a spotlight anywhere and have it referenced as the starting point and thus have more control.\nThat would be it for now, hope you found this insightful!\nIn my next post we are gonna explore some thoughts on models, visual language, props and the map itself. Stay tuned,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-02-23T20:36:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/chromo02_hu920800d2b8920e2a3c5b8bb65f90bdba_348529_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere002/","title":"Chromosphere 02 - First Blueprint Systems"},{"content":"\nA New Game I’ve been into the making and prototyping of a game from scratch the past bit less than a year. The topic of it was open, and it was up to me to decide what exactly I want to develop.\nBefore we go into what the game is about, its story, genre and so on, I want to spend a few lines talking about my initial few other ideas. The ones I went through before deciding to go with the one that I am working on right now.\nThe Rules. So to say. Why am I making the game? What are the requirements towards it? Well, for one, making games is fun. I am an artist and a designer, so why not apply all of my skills in one place and make a whole game? But there is more than that obviously. I need this game for university. This is one of my graduation projects for BA (Hons) in Games Design at University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK.\nAs far as rules go at uni, well there is a big and important one. I have to develop everything on my own, from scratch. And that is what dictates the strongest the reasoning to why exactly I chose this idea out of the total three I had initially.\nInitial Idea 01 Time Rupture\nTime Rupture is a game idea I came up with together with my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, in the distant past year of 2013. The project was created in the span of a single weekend and a bit. 72 hours. For the famous game jam website Ludum Dare. You can see our initial submission over at our blog there.\nThe idea behind the game was simple; you are a time traveller, who created a time-travel machine. You go on said machine and start to teleport through different time dimensions, going in the past, future and so on. Though the very first teleportation though, something goes wrong. The machine breaks down and pieces of it spill around you. Ten seconds pass and you are suddenly teleported somewhere else. At every teleportation you can go around and collect random bits of metal and machine pieces. Those increase your score. When the ten seconds go through, you must be back on the machine. If you are not at it, it teleport itself without you and you are suddenly stranded. You lose the game.\nScreenshot 01 - The player finds themself stranded in 2nd Century. Somewhere in Northern Thrace.\nThe idea of the game was kind of elegant in its simplicity. And as it is with most nice things, it was born out of prerequisite, not out of pure wit. The condition that birthed it was the rule of the game jam. Its theme which participant were bound to follow.\nThe theme read: 10 Seconds.\nI though it might be cool if I were to recreate the game. 3D low-poly art with some interesting light effects and particles. Assembled in Unreal Engine 4, programmed there with Blueprints. Props modelled in Maya, texturing in Substance Painter and Designer.\nAnd to back up the idea, we really did get quite a good score at the competition back in 2013, proving that there is potential in the concept:\nWe placed number 69 for the theme. Out of a total of 2213 game entries.\nI really though the idea is simple and I would be able to recreate it and even improve onto it for the one year I have at uni to develop everything.\nThe only thing that sort of stopped me is the fact that I am an artist and designer, but not much of a programmer. I can do simple visual scripting in Blueprints (which came out to not be very simple in the current state of the project, but we shall see that in the next posts), but I can’t really code anything complex in any language. And I wanted to be able to do justice to things like spawning different mechanical parts and elements into the world, using some algorithm a bit more complex and elegant than what I can sadly do on my own.\nI talked to my teachers and they said its fine if I have some help from outside. With the programming that is. As long as I keep all of the art and design elements/mechanics completely from me. And so I knew I could bring my brother to the project, and have him program a few algorithms for me. I decided to leave it to that though, and explore more ideas and maybe stumble across something I can execute more independently, just on my own.\nInitial Idea 02 - Running Out of Space Model in Maya that I created as an initial proof of concept.\nFor this game I didn’t have a working title, but again more of a working theme. Again from Ludum Dare (you can probably already guess I sort of really like that event and game jam website :P). The theme was Running Out of Space. And it sort of aligned with some ideas and notes I had been doing prior to going in the jam. The jam was held during a weekend in August, 2018. We didn’t manage to create anything playable or to submit anything, but it was still a nice exercise of generating ideas.\nInitial notes and a quick sketch I did back then.\nInitial camera view I tested. The game would be a 2.5 side view, where in 3D space you assign units what to do. You gather and manage resources and space people.\nI had some additional ideas that I though would fit perfect into this game concept. But there was one thing - in a staggering opposition with everything I said previously with the Time Rupture game idea. It’s the fact that, if I were to make this game, a sim in genre, where you deploy all kinds of units around the ship, it would require really importantly on one important thing. That thing is artificial intelligence. I would need a good AI. One that would control the units and make them move around the ship. It would let them execute the tasks the player has given them.\nWell that was an idea more complex in programming than anything else I had though about. And even though I am keeping it in my records as a project I might go back to on day, it was by no chance appropriate for university.\nInitial Idea 03 - Light is Dangerous. This \u0026ldquo;Light is Dangerous\u0026rdquo; later turned into \u0026ldquo;Chromosphere\u0026rdquo;.\nI sat down to think about a third idea. This time around the main condition: the idea needs to be simple. Execution should be possible just on my own.\nI had nothing to get me started and that’s why I took this screenshot you see up there. Its a near final round of voting for a theme. A theme for another Ludum Dare. Not sure which one or the date. But it still listed 16 themes and I though that is enough ideas to get me started.\nI took and combined \u0026ldquo;Shadows\u0026rdquo; together with \u0026ldquo;Light is dangerous\u0026rdquo;. Ye, they both kind of sound like a cliche, but I though it might be fun to explore what I can come up with.\nWhat I came up with was a puzzle game. One where you, the player are not in control of a character. Instead you are in control of the environment in which the protagonist is. The character is stranded on a piece of land. Maybe somewhere in space. Next to them is a giant sun. A star. It emits light so hot, that if the character steps in it for far too long, they starts taking damage and then burn.\nInitial sketch and notes of the idea.\nYellow note in pic above reads: \u0026ldquo;You are a spaceman\u0026hellip; who is also a vampire. You are in open space and you\u0026rsquo;ve lost your helmet. Help the vampire get to the end and retrieve their helmet.\nNotes to the side read: \u0026ldquo;Goal is to retrieve a space suit helmet. - Goofy, easy-going story.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Harder levels could have multiple units (spacemen), who walk different paths at the same time. Makes it more complex.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Trigger pressure plates on the paths that manipulate the environment on the go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Specific part of the path goes to night? Day-night cycle?\u0026rdquo;\nI think in the first page you can read where I took inspiration for the idea: during the summer, just before going back to uni, I build myself a new desktop PC. I needed a powerful GPU (I used an integrated one before that) in order to handle all of the graphic 3D work I was about to start doing in Unreal (for stuff like this project). The video card I got came with a free copy of Destiny 2. I hadn’t played it before that, but given how gorgeous and heavy in graphics it looked, I had to try my new GPU on it. I sunk in quite a few hours playing it and had a blast.\nThere was one particular level of its missions that stuck with me for a long time.\nDestiny Concept painting by Dorje Bellbrook.\nIn that mission you are on a ship just past Mercury, right next to the Sun. At some point you have to get to a specific part that is locked. You are forced to go outside the spaceship and walk on its exterior. That walk stuck with me because it had the mechanic where you had to stay in the shadow bits of the map. It was super simple and wasn’t challenging as a puzzle or anything. The game is a FPS shooter after all. But there was something really beautiful in the giant sun that you could stare right into too.\nI though about a few systems that I need to have to get the game working. Then decided they are not too complex for me to execute in just mere Blueprints, no programming language. That is when I got on board with it and started developing the game.\nThis is one of the first proof of concepts I did quickly in Unreal 4 back then.\nPrototype screenshots A few weeks of developing after that got me to this visual style and a few systems in.\nI’ll talk about how I got to this stage and what my blueprints are in the next post.\nHope you find reading this interesting.

I did some work on detail pieces and protrusions on the cathedral. Then I had a go at making some initial textures in Substance Designer.\nI put in a tessellated landscape blending material in, ready to take on a few more textures when they are ready. The muddy one you see is one I created for my Feudal Japan project. I think I like the wet, reddish look though, so I might keep it like that but give it more variety with a second texture.\nFacade I did figure out how I am going to approach the facade of the buildings though. Or at least those of the ones in the distance, still not certain about the mausoleums. I decided I will make some basic brick textures, make a few variations and vertex paint detail on top. But that will be kind of too flat and boring. As such I am going to make some decal planes to go on top, and those I will model in Zbrush, the bake between two flat planes in Substance Designer and color/texture them. If I manage to make some interesting stone ornaments and create a good normal map out of it, it should give plenty of definition.\nThe blue bits are where the alpha cards/decals are gonna go. I\u0026rsquo;ll most likely scatter more than what is seen above, but that is just an initial sketch of the idea to guide me along the way. The photos you see to the right and left are what I will try to sculpt and place on those alpha cards.\nAnd here you can see the brick texture I quickly made in Substance Designer. They are famous, brick textures, aren\u0026rsquo;t they. Or I feel more like infamous. Everyone, pro or amateur alike always has a point of their career where they make one. I guess this is another one of mine going down in the records.\nBricks I did a parallax occlusion shader for the bricks in Unreal. It gave it a very good dimension but then I decided I don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother spending ages making a vertex paint blending material that is also parallax occluded. Not only will it be super expensive performance wise, but also from the distance shot I am going for, you can\u0026rsquo;t really notice the detail it gives. It was a nice exercise nonetheless.\nI think I might spend more time in Substance Designer, making a few more brick variant textures. A few maybe quite different than the ones above. More smooth, with jarring whitish color and greater variety in roughness. I\u0026rsquo;ll then blend those on patches on top to give even more variety. And if it still looks flat I might even invest in a few patches of brickwork that is actual geometry. I\u0026rsquo;ll make them sort of modular/kit bashing in fashion and then scatter detail with them on the facades.\nUntil next time, when I hope I will have more exciting than now progress,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-02-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-004/cover004_hu839e78eb57106cd2daa8be21ac564252_289916_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-004/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 04 - Landscape and Bricks"},{"content":"Week Three: I\u0026rsquo;ve been blocking out more shapes and changing the lay-out quite a bit. I\u0026rsquo;ll be honest and say that I liked the idea of having bare land to the left of the camera, and filling it with just squarish, ordinary looking gravestones. Exactly like the cover of the short-story I mentioned in the first post. Then in the distance, I would have spooky, aggressive treeline. And although trees are nowhere to be seen yet, I was worried that they wont fill the scene up enough when I create them. I was bothered that there would be this huge patch of sky to the left, and it would distract the viewers eye out of the canvas, instead guiding it towards the inside of it.\nCrypts and Mausoleums That\u0026rsquo;s when I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to introduce some crypts, instead of having only gravestones. And even better, their prolonged silhouettes and roofs would give me more space to put on some neon signs. I had the intent to have lots of those lights from the very start. At some point I started wondering where I am going to put them, and this kind of fits.\nThey need quite a bit more detail and work, but at least their block-out shows me where I am going with it. With the neon billboards I want to suggest a story. Thus the \u0026ldquo;Personal Eternity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Cheap Cloud\u0026rdquo;. The place doesn\u0026rsquo;t look very techno heavy a part from the lights right now, but I plan on scattering some cable and wire details through some Unreal spline systems. They could go out of the cathedral and go towards each grave. Maybe those graves actually serve a purpose? Is there something in them? Servers? Storage space?\nHaven\u0026rsquo;t figured out all of it yet, but just asking those questions and suggesting those ideas help me build the place up.\nAh, by the way, that \u0026ldquo;Personal Eternity\u0026rdquo; text font to the right looks maybe a bit too Art Deco, and might really be calling for a change.\n2D Sketch: I really wanna have a go in Substance Designer at making the emissive, colored, stained glass on the windows at the distance, but that will have to be for later as there is much more to do before that. Also I settled down on the idea that it might be cool to have a tower in the middle of the canvas. That needs to be blocked out next.\nGif Progress: Time for a GIF!\nI was really unsure whether to keep the graves face the camera like I had them initially. I think it was not that bad but certainly feels a bit banal at times. Like, lets have every cool thing look straight into the eyes of the viewer. What I\u0026rsquo;ve settled down on right now, I believe looks more dynamic. Might still not be the final, as I feel like their placements lacks structure. Even though I am trying to convey the idea that its an old place and the soil started shifting and thus moving/distorting everything.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s for this time. Hope you like where its heading.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-02-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-003/cover003_hu616c93a9d8259dbce5f4207dd8c077a1_280933_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-003/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 03 - Mausoleums"},{"content":"First Week Progress: A few days passed since the last blog post about the project. I am back with some progress on the blockout. The first very notable thing is that the church (or more like cathedral, judging by its size, scale and type of architecture) actually looks like something now. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on it quite a bit but we are still in the phase of weird mixture of modelling bits that are finished but need texturing and tiny bit more detail, and others that are still placeholders.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been tweaking the scale of the different volumes for each part of the building. I don\u0026rsquo;t want it too massive, as I am limited on how long I can work on the project. At the same time I don\u0026rsquo;t want it dull and tiny. Above you can see a view from Maya. I don\u0026rsquo;t have it as one big chuck in Unreal. I\u0026rsquo;ve split it into multiple files so I can optimise the textures and light maps better later on.\nThe initial idea was to have all kinds of graves with variety of gravestones on top scattered all around. As such I\u0026rsquo;ve been modelling some of those.\nI will most likely still be tweaking their position so I can make the best composition in the main shot of the whole place. I\u0026rsquo;ll also work on more detail with the texts and neon on them.\nScripts and Symbols As I promised in my last post, lets dive into what exactly the writing that I\u0026rsquo;ve put in right now stands for.\nMy initial idea was to change the inscriptions on each gravestones with a neon. I though I might try a fancy looking script. The ones that can be seen in old-fashioned movies and neon signs. Then I started to wonder, what would I write on those gravestones? Names? I mean, that\u0026rsquo;s what goes on gravestones, right? I decided I will have to create some random, obviously fake names (so no one sees a name of someone they know and gets creeped out, or even worse, offended). And because I want variety and more Cyberpunk-ish vibe, I thought I might try a few different languages too. That\u0026rsquo;s when I decided it might be fun to try something very, very old. To try to use a script that exists and is real, but is no longer in use.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I looked back into my native language for some inspiration. Bulgarian uses Cyrillic alphabet. To quickly introduce you to it, I\u0026rsquo;ll quote Wikipedia.\nThe early Cyrillic alphabet was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD at the Preslav Literary School by Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Naum and replaced the earlier Glagolithic script developed by the Byzantine theologians Cyril and Methodius.\nAnd now, next time you see Russian, you will know that their script has origins quite deeper and further away, into lands different from their own, and more close to those of my home, Bulgaria. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have you here to bore you with History lessons. Soooo, back to the topic at hand!\nThe so called Glagolitic script is what I was after. I thought that its weird visual look might add quite a bit of interest to the scene. Another fun detail is that I can actually write real phrases with it, as Glagolitic has its script correspond to Cyrillic letters with exact match in sound and use. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will dive in that too deeply for now.\nGoing away from scripts and languages, lets mention what the neon sign on the very top of the building stands for.\nI want to have different symbols and signs in neon on the top. I\u0026rsquo;ve thought of multiple ideas I might try later on. One was to create a logo and design that implements the infinity symbol in it. To sort of broadcast towards the viewer the idea that this cathedral is a place of technology. Old and abandoned but afterwards repurposed, as I said in my last post. And maybe, in it, in this Cyberpunk world, people cheat death. They augment bodies to make them immortal. If said bodies get damaged irreversibly, maybe they transfer consciousness into new shells. I decided infinity sign might be a bit dull and is kind of overused. That\u0026rsquo;s when I remembered about the Ouroboros. Which basically translates to the same idea, but looks much more mystical and cool, we can agree I am sure. And when I was searching for some inspiration on that, I came across by a wood sculpture detail from Andrea Brustolon. It implements the idea of a snake eating its own tail, and also has a woman body in it. What a cool idea, I thought!\nI can make my own version and convey the idea of infinity through the creation of new bodies through science. But I will have to work more on the designs later on.\nProgress GIF And because I just love GIFs, lets have one now and see the progress so far:\nHope you are finding the progress, and reading about it, interesting.\nDev log number two out, until next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-02-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-002/cover002_hue15e6e8e5796230f1327aef16ce308be_222815_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-002/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 02 - Blockout Props"},{"content":"Idea and Research Starting a new environment, I decided to share the creative process with anyone out there that might have an interest. I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to share a lot of development images. Not only I want to show you the thing though, but I want to tell you about it too. As such at times I will be wordy. I hope that if nothing else, you find it at least intriguing.\nWe are making quite a sharp turn, going from way back in 15-16th century Feudal Japan to the not so distant future. A ruined, probably abandoned cemetery. On the very top of its hill, a chapel stands proud. But there is a weird, modern twist to this. The world in which this place resides is a gritty, Cyberpunk world. One full of neon signs, electric colors, rain and vapour. The churchyard has been repurposed.\nFirst screenshot looking at the project. Yep, you are not wrong, there is nothing of what I described above as an atmosphere in this. Not yet at least. This is an early greyboxing level phase. But before I show you more screenshots, in this first blog post, I want to first talk about the source of the idea.\nNeon Lights I got the initial idea (that changed a lot) from a magazine that I grabbed from a shop I randomly visited at the centre of London last summer. It\u0026rsquo;s the sort of store, where you see an original Marvel comics from now nearly a century ago displayed at its showcase window and you immediately think that its a place you gotta walk into. The magazine I bought is Analog Science Fiction and Science Fact, or that\u0026rsquo;s what it used to call itself back in November 1972. That\u0026rsquo;s when the issue I got was first published. It\u0026rsquo;s cover painting is what allured me to buy it though, more than anything else.\nI loved the \u0026ldquo;retro sci-fi\u0026rdquo; vibe of the painting. Cemetery World, it said. By Clifford D. Simak. The illustration is by John Schoenherr.\nTo Mother Earth the star-flung humans returned for their final rest.\nBut the worldwide Cemetery was something far more sinister than a burial ground.\nAnd far more dangerous.\nI will spare you a lot of details. The very cool one though, the shoulders of which the whole story stands on, is the idea that Earth is turned into a cemetery. Humanity expanded throughout the Solar System and then into distant planets and stars. Earth was left. Abandoned. Civilisation remembers it though, and whenever someone passes away, they are sent back. They are carried through countless light-years of distance and buried on Earth. And so the planet is turned into a Cemetery World.\nIn the story Earth is sort of flat lands and wherever you look what meets the eye is only gravestones. There is a bit more than that, of course, but I will skip it for now. But I recommend everyone to read the story if they like the sound of it.\nAfter I read that, I got the idea for a 3D work. A landscape where everything is filled with gravestones. And if its mainly gravestones, I thought, then it might not be that time consuming to create. As such I left it in my mind, as a sort of quick 3D project to go back to later on.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when I started the Feudal Japan challenge that I mentioned. And for the 2 months whilst making that, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get the cemetery idea out of my mind. And while working on Japanese architecture, I listened to quite a few albums on a loop. And one of them was Twenty One Pilot\u0026rsquo;s new one Trench. If you\u0026rsquo;ve heard the album, you will know where I am going with this.\nThe album features songs with quite the odd names, and then even weirder lyrics. But that\u0026rsquo;s what I, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure everyone else that listens to them, loves about them. One of the songs goes by the name Neon Gravestones.\n♪ ♫ Neon gravestones try to call for my bones\u0026hellip; call\u0026hellip; call\u0026hellip; call\u0026hellip; ♪ ♫\nAnd when I heard that lyrics, I got the mental image. The churchyard with the countless gravestones. A chapel on top of the hill. And then the best part — everything was in neon lights. A mockery of death of some kind. On top of the church there would be neon lights advertising something. The gravestones, instead of having ordinary chiselled inscriptions into the stone, would have neon lights too. I then knew I want to have a go making a 3D environment out of it.\nMore Light. James Turrell. I wanted to research more visual aspects, before doing any block-outs. Light is of a very big importance in this project, and I was worried I wont know in what direction to go with it. As such I gathered a few reference sheets, with countless of neon light signs and lots of electric colors. That is when I came across the name of James Turrell.\nI came across an art installation by him. One that deals exclusively with light. And even better, it has a chapel in it. It\u0026rsquo;s situated in a cemetery in Berlin, where supposedly notable German figures like Hegel are buried.\nI am very happy I stumbled so randomly upon Turrell\u0026rsquo;s name. The elegance, with which he uses light, I am not so sure I will manage to replicate. But still, the idea itself, will help me turn into the right direction for my environment. I read more into Turrell, and found lots of amazing aspects of his work about which he talks.\nIn my work, light is not so much something that reveals as it is itself the revelation.\nHe says how:\nThere is no object in my work. There never was. There is no image within it.\nAnd I would love to have a go at replicating that feel. I know it wont 100% work in my case. I am going to be modelling props and making fancy architectural elements on my buildings. I will light them up in the fashion that he does, but they will be the object. At the end, my work wont be as elegant and simple as his. Going for Cyberpunk, there will be a clustering of light unlike what we see with his.\nI am still very happy I got to read about his work, because it made me think of light in a different way. Instead of as a tool, as an object of interest itself. In a case where we don\u0026rsquo;t care about what it illuminates. We care about the light itself.\nAnother Progress Shot: And now, given how lengthy this already is, I\u0026rsquo;ll just show you to what point I got after all of this research.\nThere is a weird circular neon sign and even more weird symbols in front of the gravestones, but I will talk about those next time. I will also show more in detail how I got to this step.\nI hope you find what you are seeing and reading interesting.\nUntil next time,\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2019-01-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/cover001_hua0e5d7ddb325003f7ba2e0321899424e_244042_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-001/","title":"The Neon Graveyard - 01 - Start"},{"content":"Forewords Towards the end of December 2018, few weeks after I wrapped up my project \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo;, I was approached online with an invitation to write about my process of creation. The invitation came from the creator of a website I had not heard of until then. The web was called IndieWatch.\nI loved the idea and quite honestly was immensely flattered that someone took the time to write to me, let alone invite me to be featured onto their website.\nFew years later this website closed and as such my article is sadly no longer up online. In order to bring it back to you here, I used a snapshot from 2022 as captured by Internet Achieve\u0026rsquo;s Wayback Machine.\nEnjoy.\nArticle Introduction: My name is Peter Dimitrov. I am a freelance illustrator and painter, who in the last 3 years stepped in the realms of 3D art. I started studying at the University of Central Lancashire (Preston, UK), pursuing bachelors in Games Design. That is where I started to practice 3D for the first time (started around 2016. I will be graduating first quarter of 2019).\nI was invited here, to write an article about the development of my latest, and as of now, first published 3D project. My debut in the medium, so to say.\nOne final disclaimer before we begin. In this article, I will briefly mention certain techniques but will link resources towards their use. I encourage you to look into them. Sadly I am limited in the number of things I can explain, as there is only so much I can cover without getting overly lengthy!\nThe name of the project is The Animal Shrine. It is an entry for an Artstation Challenge going by the topic of Feudal Japan. But before we go into any explanations, I invite you to take a look at the full finished project, over at my portfolio, here. The project was created from scratch in 49 days. That was the length of the challenge. We were prohibited from using any libraries of 3D models or textures.\nSoftware: First off, I will start by introducing you into my use of software. We all know that there are multiple programs out there, and a vast amount of ways to accomplish a certain task. My pipeline is an amalgamation of software that I’ve been taught to use at university plus lots of (and predominantly) self-taught techniques.\nThe whole project is put together in Unreal Engine 4. I’ve used one of the latest versions right now (4.21), deploying features ranging from being vital – for example for the look of my Volumetric Fog particle system; to small and relatively not important ones, such as Geographically Accurate Sun Positioning (which I ended up not using at end, but is still a cool thing you can look into).\nEvery prop and texture you see is created by me. For their making, I modeled most of them in Autodesk Maya. At the start of the challenge, when I had more time, I turned every model into a high-poly one in Maya, and then moved it into Zbrush in order to increase the poly count even more and hand-sculpt some detail on the surfaces. I would then decimate the final result, and bake it into the low-poly version that I had UV-mapped prior to that. For mapping, I used the new Maya 2017 upgraded UV editor. I got a few comments on how it must have been crazy mapping everything. It indeed was, but probably the sole reason I managed to make everything in the tight deadline of the 2 months we were given, was this new UV editor. A lot of stuff in it is automated and saves tons of time. One big example would be the feature to scale every UV island so that they match the texel density. Something, that prior to this would be done by eye, by applying a checker-board texture, and scaling up and down everything by hand, trying to match what you see. Well no more. By the end of the challenge, I sadly had no more time to hand-sculpt every detail. As such, I started to bake high-poly on low, without sculpting anything on the high. Might sound pointless, but you still generate Ambient Occlusion, Curvature and Thickness Maps, and they can be vital in the quick making of textures.\nWhen talking about baking maps, its good to mention where I do that. I used Substance Painter. Baking any kinds of maps in that program, Normals, Ambient Occlusion (AO), or anything else, is literally like a child’s play. Use of xNormal or Maya for baking maps still exists in the industry, but I see no point in that, given that we have Painter. Making your maps in it would be only a matter of firstly making sure that your UVs are created in a good way. Then, secondly, you turn your low into high-poly, export them separate making sure that they match locations. Most of the time you won’t even need a cage file.\nI created a lot of materials in Substance Designer. Those would be basic textures like wood, gold, paper, stone, ground dirt and so on. I noticed that I am very picky when it comes to wooden textures, and as such created around 2-3 very different in visual look materials. I wasn’t sure on which one to settle down, but it all turned out good as I realized that I can just combine them in different ways after importing them in Painter, and achieve a lot of variety. I will share a few tips that require a bit more advanced knowledge in Substance Designer.\nI exported every material as ( * ).sbsar. I then imported that for use in Painter. Its crazy how much you can do, if before exporting, you expose the right variables. In Designer, the work you do goes into final nodes called Outputs. My suggestion would be to run your final results for each node into one final node before that. Expose said node and then have control over everything. For example: for Base Color, get your work into a HSL Node, expose the Hue, expose the Saturation and expose the Light. Put that into the Output. For the Normal, expose the Intensity. Before the Roughness output, put a Levels node, and expose every single aspect of it too. Now save that as ( * ).sbsar. Import it to Painter. When you open it there and apply the material to part of your model, you will see that suddenly, if you don’t like the color, you can go in the parameters of the material (whilst still in Painter, no need to go back to Designer) and just tweak the HSL sliders to your liking. You might import the finalized model into Unreal. Suddenly you see that it’s too shiny for your liking. You can go into the material in Painter again, and control the Levels you exposed in the Roughness and tweak everything to your liking once more.\nAll of the stuff I said about exposing parameters might come out as a bit basic. But if you are smart about it, with just a little time investment you can create so much more. I created those basic wood materials you see and then exposed their color and roughness. Then, in Painter, using Smart Masks (deploying the Curvature and Thickness masks I’ve baked), I combined different types of wood, changed their color and roughness, and basically created a few materials that inside Painter I packed as Smart Materials. Then whenever I had a new model, fully baked, I would just slap that Smart Material on top and have a very good looking base to work off of in just a few clicks. For a project with such a tight deadline that was very important.\nThe only software, that I’ve used and not yet mentioned, would be World Machine and SpeedTree.\nKind of self-explanatory by their names, I used World Machine to create the mountains you see in the background. I am very much a beginner when it comes to that software, having picked it up for the first time only for this project. Still, its node based design, much like Substance Designer, was not hard to navigate at all. I created a very basic looking mountain deploying different noises. From the software, I exported a high-poly base model. You can work on the texture there too, and export bitmaps, but I had no time to dive into that. Instead, I took my high-poly in Zbrush. There I decimated it to low poly and used UV Master to generate UVs. I took both into Painter, baked channels, and used those channels to color it. It’s very easy, because stuff like the peaks of your mountain, go on a very specific value on the Curvature and Thickness bitmaps. As such, using some of the Smart Masks, you can pick the very tips of the mountain, and color them in white, to have snow for example. Change the value of Roughness to be shiny, and suddenly in under a minute, you have a very realistic looking mountain. I imported the model in Unreal, and just spinning and scaling it around, faked some variety and very long mountain range by reusing the model.\nFoliage Most of the foliage you can see is created in Maya. The bamboo tree you see close to the camera in some of the shots is assembled in SpeedTree. The tree in the very distance is again created in Maya. For their creation, I used a pipeline very well explained by Karen Stanley. I made basic low-poly leaves and grasses in Maya. Some of them, I took into Zbrush for some detailing. Those high-poly models, I then took into Designer and having created a low-poly base plane and a cage, putting the foliage props in-between them, much like a pressing a flower between the pages of a book, I baked maps from which I colored and created my foliage textures.\nThis about covers the basics.\nPainting and 2D Mediums Unfortunately, there is much I have no time to go through, as it would call for the writing of multiple tutorials and not just a single article! There is only one final note left that I want to make. When working on an environment like this, pay attention to how the whole place looks. Look at the whole picture. Make smart decisions about your layout, the silhouette that your buildings and props make. Look around with your camera and try to capture dynamic shots from the very beginning, even if most props are just gray-boxed placeholders. If your composition is boring from the very start, even the most detailed and pristine model, modeling and texture wise, will not fix your problem or make the picture look better. I feel like all of this is something that can be much more obvious in painting and 2D. Study composition making in illustration and photography, even if you don’t have much of an interest in those mediums. They still can teach you a lot and improve the quality of your 3D work exponentially.\nThankfully, I can give you a good example of this project. I started the whole thing by containing it into one big rectangular shape. That would be a second, elevated level to which you go through some steps at the very front. I did lots of research and reference gathering before starting the project. My research told me, that in Japan, they indeed made shrines and places like the one I am creating, very contained, fenced in a very rectangular way.\nBelievably like that, did not change the fact, that even though I had some buildings even on another scaffold level, the whole place still looked very boring. I would fly around trying to pick some dynamic angles. I had few, but still not many, and even those came out a bit boring. At that point, as suggested by some friends and people over at my university, I decided to take a few of the buildings I had created to the ground level, and separate everything even more. That’s how the final layout was born.\nTimelapse I capture a lot of screenshots during the development. I assembled lots of them into one final, dev video. It overlooks the place in an aerial type of shot, before changing to a closer camera. You can clearly see what I explained there. You can watch it over on Youtube.\nConclusion It was a pleasure to write this, and I do hope you find it useful and insightful. While working on our entries for the competition, we were requested to keep as detailed as a possible blog. To sort of prove that everything is indeed our work. You can go and read mine for some more tips and insight. Find it over here. I also created a sort of cinematic fly-trough video, trying to convey a story I made up for the place.\nIf you would like to follow my work, you can do so over at Artstation, Instagram or Facebook.\nTake care, and if you liked the article, do keep an eye here on IndieWatch too.

The end. I can\u0026rsquo;t believe it. This is the first project of such a big scale that I\u0026rsquo;ve done in 3D, and it was quite the ride! As I promised, I worked a lot on a video, in order to show you the idea of the whole place.\nThe Animal Shrine. As some of the Japanese texts I have on the walls of my calligraphers workshop suggest, this shrine is a place where you can leave gifts and pray to different animals. At first, it sounds like it is a thing for fortune, and good health, but read deeper and you shall come across sentences like \u0026ldquo;Those who bring gifts shall have powers\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Point at your enemies and the animals shall follow\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;The commander of the animals\u0026rdquo;.\nBut before I say anything more, here is the video. Enjoy:\nVideo flythrough (YouTube video embedded above. It\u0026rsquo;s the main flythrough video showcase of the scene.)\nIn Japanese culture, as well as in lots of others, the animals I have depicted have a very common appearances. In Japan rabbits are thought to bring fertility, cranes were thought to be immortal and as such were considered secret. Frogs, some say, bring luck. All of that is referenced on the walls of the calligraphers, but I wanted to take it further. See if I could come up with something more mysterious and weird. And then actually have a go at executing it and telling it as a story through a video.\nIt was quite the challenge, I will tell you, and I redid that video about 4 times. Unreal\u0026rsquo;s Sequencer gave me lots of trouble too. It was good though, that along the way of making my props, I was exposing every single parameter possible. That gave me control over the colors of the lights, and the glowing eyes.\nSome more screenshots:\nProcess timelapse video I have a second video for you. A sort of a development time-lapse:\n(YouTube video embedded above. Shows a timelapse of the building up of the entire scene, from the placeholders beginning to the end.)\nI did not take 431 screenshots, in order to have them unrecorded and not seen\u0026hellip; This is not all of them, of course, but I made sure to take lots of specific angles through the making, and them combine them in a video. Hope you find it interesting.\n(I\u0026rsquo;m quite happy with this shot above, but I am leaving it down here, in the hopes that you first see it in the Video, and won\u0026rsquo;t get the whole surprise element spoiled.)\nBut now lets go to some technical talk. I recorded the scene in real time. The FPS is around 40-50 constant, but would occasionally drop down to 25-30 when looking through the cameras that overlook absolutely the whole place. I think you can feel a few frames drop on the first video.\nAt some point I was kind of convinced that I will not be able to record anything in real time, given that I am pushing my models and textures to appeal visually at their best. LODs are something I would love to do, but maybe not in a short challenge like this. I\u0026rsquo;ve tried to be very reasonable with my choice of texture sizes and my stacking of multiple objects on one texture sets. My machine is not bad, but it is by no means top-end either. I have a strong video card (gtx 1070), but pretty outdated CPU and only 8 gb of RAM. As such I am actually pretty happy with how the scene is running.\nMaterials and Callout Sheet Let\u0026rsquo;s see my materials and call-out sheet for my models:\nFirst row: paper, gold, porcelain, bamboo. Second row is my landscape blending materials plus a weird looking hay I used for the \u0026ldquo;hanging rope\u0026rdquo; detail piece you can see in the second picture.\nFirst row here is some basic wood materials I did in Substance. I then combined them in different ways, using Smart Masks in Painter. Last material is the stone I use in the scene. I made a simple one with exposed parameters for cracks and for hue. I then overlaid green version on top in order to make some cheap moss effect.\nThis project was lots of fun to do guys. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been to bed all night. I mean, its morning here in the UK right now, but when I woke up around 20 hours ago, to begin work on this, I knew it was going to be my final day on it. It made me feel kind of weird, melancholic. It\u0026rsquo;s stupid, I know, but lots of you are so amazingly good at what you do, my only chance to catch up was to work crazy hours. And in those crazy hours, I got so used to this project, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m gonna feel empty for a quite a while, given that I will not wake up to have a stroll in it first thing.\nI want to thank all of you out there for the kind comments and words I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten along the way here. Also, great thanks to all of my relatives, and friends, who put up with me, talking about this project, every. single. day\u0026hellip; Got quite a lot of support over at my university too, so thank you guys over there too.\nI have to mention my friend Rika Kanaya again. She is the one behind the translations of my weird ideas from English to Japanese. She guided me through on how to put it in texts. Thank you Rika!\nI hope you enjoyed my project, and I hope that the video and story gave you at least a bit of a kick-out. I think I will have a long break now. Maybe spend a week or two, just in the realms of the 2D, with some casual painting. :P\nThanks for reading. As always, have a good one. May we meet again in another project, just as fun as this one (but maybe, a titbit less stressful).\nRecollections and memories. Update from 2023 As I am here porting this old blog log into my new, personal blog website, I wanted to spend a few lines and talk about things I remember and recollect from this project. From the time I wrote the above at 4-5 am, in that sunless, British morning in my student accommodation flat over in Preston where I studied Game Design.\nAbove I talk about melancholy. I very much to this day remember the feeling and could go on to describe it in detail even now, 5 years later. Indeed, the daily opening and navigation of the scene branded into my mind strongly the space. For the following months, even a year and a bit after I finished this scene I remember having occasional moments of closing my eyes and in front of me, in my mind\u0026rsquo;s eye, seeing the Japanese scene.\nThis was happening and was incredibly strong the few days after I finished the project so I occasionally had moments of pondering if this project will indeed be engrained into my DNA for the rest of my life and if I will be revisiting it in my nightly dreams all the time.\nSince then I\u0026rsquo;ve done quite a few more scenes and I don\u0026rsquo;t think any of them have come as close as to this one as being entangled into my mind and my psyche. That is even through the fact that most of my scenes after this one, I\u0026rsquo;ve spent more hours on and I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and done much better job at detail, space, texture, color and composition.\nThere might be only one space so engrained into my mind, now that I think of it. That would perhaps be my section of the Sniper Elite 5 multiplayer map \u0026ldquo;Flooded Village\u0026rdquo; that I worked on over at Rebellion. If in the scene above I spent two and a bit months of opening it and navigating its space daily, then Flooded Village I have spend 3-4 times that. As such I got the same \u0026ldquo;Tetris effect\u0026rdquo; where on some days my mind wonders off and I go into a daydream. In that daydream I find myself into the space and zones of Flooded Village.\nTech talk though\u0026ndash;things I got wrong above, in the initial post in 2018. I talk about pushing my visuals to the very max and as such my performance suffering when I am overlooking the entire Japanese scene. Well, yes, I did give it my max but back then my max was not that demanding on resources as detail in textures, and geometry, is relatively lacking. That is if you compare it to my current works. As such there was another missing piece of the puzzle. The piece dragging my performance down. That is draw calls. Even though the lanterns you see above lack animations at the end, I did leave them as Movable Blueprints, as such splitting each lantern into its own, individual draw call. The little tiles that make up the paths, I scaled on the x;y;z in all kinds of fractions, splitting each and one of them into individual draw call as well.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve not run any profiling to see my draw calls in that scene (I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about it back in 2018). And I hardly have the time to go back into that project now and check, but I can guarantee you that indeed the draw calls are needlessly high.\nAs such whenever you work on your projects, pay attention to them. If you wish, you can read more about draw calls over here (if you somehow missed the blog in the first place).\nYou can find the gallery for \u0026ldquo;The Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo; with all of its screenshots and videos over here.\nEven with its problems this project still has a special place in my heart. Over time, in the last few years, I also realized that this is one of my most popular projects (most likely due to me writing about its process over at 80 lv website. Also being featured in The Rookies and getting printed in 3D Magazine thanks to a rubric about The Rookies.)\nSince its making I think I\u0026rsquo;ve grown a lot and learned tons more about art, 3D, composition and crafting good spaces. Yet I try to embrace this project, knowing how much it\u0026rsquo;s enjoyed by most of the lovely people that follow my art online.\nAs such thank you very much for reading through the blogs about the making of this.\nThank you for all of the nice words, to those of you who have reached out.\nAll the best,\nPete.\n","date":"2018-12-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/00shrineCover_hub97b978b1de28da4611ae5e9792db882_442208_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-019/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 19 - Final"},{"content":"Things that should have been done long ago My, my, I have a mountain in. It\u0026rsquo;s not like it was not a vital prop, and its not like there are just 2 days to go\u0026hellip; Priorities, right? It was super fun to do. I booted up World Machine for the first time, and at the start wasn\u0026rsquo;t certain what I am getting into, but its node based design, just like Substance, helped me navigate and get my bearing relatively easy. Exported high-poly from there, and took it to Zbrush for decimation and then Painter for baking and some color passes using the curvature and thickness.\nTell me that the screenshot from Painter doesn\u0026rsquo;t make the mountain look like ice cream\u0026hellip;\nMy only consideration now, is that I\u0026rsquo;m not too sure how the trees in the distance fit in the scene. I tried to change them, I have better prop for them, but my FPS goes down crazily, even after quite a bit of optimisation. I prefer to keep those jaggedly trees, and be able to record a nice video with good FPS. I don\u0026rsquo;t want it for the fly-through of it, the scene is quite limited to viewing angles anyways, but I really want it for the telling of a story through it. One I\u0026rsquo;ve had in mind for ages now.\nShrine I really needed that tiger statue in order to record the kind of video I want. I wanted to give it a more dynamic pose and so put it as if its ready to slap someone. Didn\u0026rsquo;t have much time to detail it, but it will do. Before moving it to that pose, I exported it sitting straight too though, in order to use that for the shrine.\nHopefully this is the last post, and next one is the final.\nAs usual, thanks for reading, have a good one.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-018/cover018_hu8252272d63a09cb0a8aefa30045cefba_419268_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-018/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 18 - World Machine"},{"content":"Foliage, Sky and Props Started photo-bashing my own sky. Finally got into SpeedTree, and using the leaves that I created ages ago, plus a new bamboo texture, I produced a better looking result. My tree in the distance still needs replacing though. The mountains too.\nI toned down nearly every light in the scene. Especially the bamboo candles (which still need texturing, so sad\u0026hellip;). Also increased the area of lots of them, trying to achieve more clarity and go away from the small clusters of bright lights, that would be more appropriate for modern skyline, than a feudal village in the middle of the woods\u0026hellip; Could they do with more work? Sure, but we will see what can be done with the tight deadline.\nI felt like I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had a better opportunity to create spherical paper lanterns than this anytime soon. So that is what I did, an orange and a yellow version. I feel like they improved the mood and atmosphere quite a bit. They also made some of the random spotlights I had scattered around, feel like they actually have a source now.\nThe empty space in the Calligraphers, I filled a bit more, trying to tell a story of some sorts. It\u0026rsquo;s hard though, as I don\u0026rsquo;t have time to produce more props.\nInterior Cushions are looking kind of shy, but we will see if I have any free time to work on them more. Before that, I feel like the floor material and walls need my attention first.\nAny comments are much appreciated.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been saying I will for what, maybe like 3-4 posts? Quite happy with how they turned out. I was worried that given that I fitted 25 of them in one texture set, there wont be enough texel density, and I wont be able to make them look proper. No matter if the texture were 1k or 2k. But they actually work quite well, even from up close.\nStarted them by making a paper and a sort of \u0026ldquo;gold leaf\u0026rdquo; materials in Designer. Got them in Painter, and then the first one I did, is actually the one with the branches detail. I went in Photoshop beforehand, and hand painted an alpha for it. I was quite happy to draw and paint once again, given that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to do so since I\u0026rsquo;ve started this challenge.\nI quickly realised, though, that I don\u0026rsquo;t really need alphas drawn in Photoshop, as I can draw just as good straight into Painter with the gold itself. I think this was the most fun thing I\u0026rsquo;ve done for the project so far. That vase is also hand-painted. So I hope you like it\u0026hellip; No pressure\u0026hellip; hand-painted\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m kidding, its not that impressive once you turn the symmetry on. :P\nMore screenshots Furniture texture is looking kind of rough here and there, but I will have to keep it like this if I want to actually accomplish everything I\u0026rsquo;ve planned.

He just could not count right back then), what a fitting number. I just realised I have deleted one of my Zbrush sculpts\u0026hellip; I am nearly certain I won\u0026rsquo;t need it again, and even if I do, I can start off right from the decimated, exported version of it, but still, made me wonder where the heck I am looking when deleting files\u0026hellip; I blame Photoshop though, as it refused to launch and demanded for more \u0026ldquo;scratch disk space\u0026rdquo; and thus sent me into a chaotic (and apparently unsuccessful) process of trying to tidy up my vast collection of rubbish.\nAnyhow, I sculpted and textured the stones the big shrine goes onto and also worked on the shrine itself too. My first version of the stone texture had lots of bricks and extrusions on it. It was too detailed and noisy though, so I stepped back to the ordinary stone material. I still plan on scattering a few more small statues on top, and adding more candles too, so it surely wont be left without enough detail.\nTweaked the lights in the calligraphers and actually created a proper light source prop for them.\nProps Textured the tsukue (desk) and put an ink holder on top together with some ink blobs on the desk itself. I\u0026rsquo;m going to create a few pens and brushes that go on special stands, and one of them will be rolled and have spilled its ink, as if someone left in a hurry.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve planned on quite a few more props to fill the empty space.

Texturing this was a self-exploration in the sense of realising that I am incredibly picky when it comes to wood textures\u0026hellip; The result you see is a combination of 2-3 materials I made in Designer, combined with Smart Masks in Painter after a bake of high-poly sculpted quickly in Zbrush.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll show you the materials properly rendered in Designer, but that will be later, as I am a bit too lazy to go back once again to those dreadful graphs (dreadful in the sense of I, going back to them multiple times, after realising that I\u0026rsquo;ve forgot to expose a specific value, exporting them multiple times, and relying to naming conventions similar but just as plainly unimaginative as wooden01, wooden02, wood03_final, wood03_final01, wood_final_final\u0026hellip;).\nAlthough I tried to have some color variety in the wood itself, I knew that I will need to break it up with some ornaments. Also I really wanted to have something metallic in my scene. Every cool kid seems to have one texture set with just alphas for ornaments so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t skip on making one myself. I did that by baking in Designer some high-poly shapes I made in Maya and Zbrush. Using the Normal and Curvature together with deploying a vast number of Levels Nodes to get some specific edges, I build up some color and roughness variation in the gold.\nWhat I love about that pipeline is the fact that I can go back to my bake set-up, quickly add some more shapes, and after I do a new bake in Designer, the newly created shapes will instantly have the golden look without me having to do any more work. Also right now my texture set is 60-70% empty, so I have plenty of space to create some more interesting shapes and motives, instead of just the circles and the other one.\nThe way I\u0026rsquo;ve illuminated the front of that building is very theatrical and dramatic. Although I really, really like it, I will most certainly tweak it later on.\nNext up is to model out some more furniture in there and also finally put some proper paper textures and roughness on those scrolls and posters.\nAs usual, thanks for reading.

Well I was sort of wrong back then, as my tessellation wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. I knew that, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t as much matter back then as I had no height information. Well, the other day, when I created that height, it put me in quite the stressful situation of spending the whole day trying to figure out how to finish the blending of the height itself.\nAnyway, I got it working, then spend tiny bit of time on a grassy-mossy looking material and one that\u0026rsquo;s kind of rocky. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to post renders of them now, as they are far away from finished. Still, its nice to have some roughness information on the landscape. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have more grassy bits, but I will do that when I have proper foliage/flowers to put on top, because without that it will just look silly.\nThe brick path leading to the staircase that you can see, I redid about two or three times. First time it was too perfect. Then it was too chaotic and broken, with pieces everywhere. I tried elevating the whole thing. Then I tried having it go a bit inside the landscape. At the end I settled down on what you see now.\nNo, your eyes are not deceiving you—I finally have that calligraphers hut interior and some scrolls! (not finished and texture, but a progress nonetheless).\nThere is some thought into the text. As such I want to thank my good friend Rika Kanaya for helping me with the translation to Japanese. Lots of the texts are just wishes for good fortune. Just like what my research led me believe is the common practice. But then we have a few sentences that lead to some story about the place. It\u0026rsquo;s meant to be a flavour text, so you wont be missing much if you, like me, can\u0026rsquo;t read Japanese.\nA few scrolls call the shrine an \u0026ldquo;Animal Shrine\u0026rdquo;. Then some, like the very long one in the very middle of the picture above, explain that, \u0026quot;\u0026hellip;this Shrine is a place for those who want to command the animals as their soldiers.\u0026quot;. Among others are \u0026ldquo;Spirits inhabit this place.\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;The statues shall come to life.\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Point at your enemies and the animals will follow.\u0026rdquo;. I made those so they lead to a story that I came up with the other week. The story is that you could leave gifts at the shrine and get involved in some kind of summoning ritual, where you can send thousands of critters after an enemy of yours. The animals would do your bidding. Its quite the fantasy spin, but that is what I like the most - fantasy works. I am hoping to be able to showcase that idea through my final video using some cheap effects, but honestly, I might not have the time to get that far.\nConstruction (No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t waste my time modelling a sign, but still wanted to see one in there for the giggles. :P Courtesy of.)\nAs always, thanks for reading!

It\u0026rsquo;s actually more than just a greybox, as I split the hut properly into finalised modular pieces, UV mapped most of them and even turned the front one that\u0026rsquo;s kind of dramatically lit in the picture, into a high-poly. It\u0026rsquo;s all ready for some arduous hand-sculpting in Zbrush before baking and texturing.\nThe other day I made a rabbit sculpture. Today I made two frogs. I have this idea that the shrine could be one for offerings towards animals like rabbits, frogs, turtles, cranes, foxes and so on. All of them are seen in specific ways in Japanese culture, and I could have references to that in the calligraphers hut with the scrolls on the walls. I mean, those are common animals, they have their role in every single culture, but still I thought it could be an interesting and nice way to fill in the empty space of the environment. Also its an opportunity for me to have a go at making my own sculpts and seeing what I can produce.\nI got a grand idea about all of them tying up together in a specific way, to be seen in my final video fly-through, but we will see if I have the time to do it, so I won\u0026rsquo;t go into explaining it this early.\nIn other news, I finally sculpted and textured the staircase, the Komainu and the modular fence pieces. I am quite happy with the dog and the stairs, but those wood textures of the fencing could probably do with some more work.\nAnd here are the modular pieces:\nI\u0026rsquo;ll make some golden ornaments to break up the places in the wood where its too uniform (I mean, look at that corner piece\u0026hellip;), but I am more worried for the wood texture itself. I tried quite a few ones I made in Designer, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t like any of them. I will have to try again I presume.\nGif progression As I haven\u0026rsquo;t posted any GIFs in ages, lets have one:\nYou can notice the change in the calligraphers hut here easier. Something else too - I completely changed the source of the light in the scene. It was coming from the left, but I rotated it to go directly from the right (as seen from this camera angle). It put the right-hand side into a dramatic shadow, giving much more dynamic feel to the whole scene.\nTalking about the light-source also makes me think how I will need to work on the skybox at some point. It\u0026rsquo;s not seen much from this angle, but in my other main camera shot, we can see the sky quite a bit more. And then that reminds me that I need actual mountains and trees (or bamboo) in the distance. And all of that reminds me of even more unfinished stuff, but lets stop this rabbit-hole here. Ahhhh! Maybe I should have some rabbit holes too? Would be mysterious, right? Nah, I\u0026rsquo;m just kidding.\nThanks for reading.

I also did some work on the landscape actor. The textures on the land are a placeholder and the colors maybe a bit too red, but I am really happy with how my Landscape Blending Material works. Created it in a such a way that its very easy to include a new texture and also parameters for roughness and tiling amount are exposed.\nHere are the modular bits:\nI decided to go a bit heavier on geometry, because my main shots include those pieces repeated so much that they take quite a bit of screen space. Instead of tileable texture, I sculpted the two pieces, baked and then used my stone material I showed a few posts ago. Exposing HSV of it proved very useful as I was able to give it this green look that way. I might make the surface of the stones more light so they appear a bit more grey later on.\nMeme A meme to illustrate my thoughts (image not mine, its a meme after all). In an ideal world for an ideal game, I would have to do lots of optimizing with a few LODs for that modular prop. But as its not gonna get repeated that much and as we are dealing with specific angle shots, I can save time and not do it. That\u0026rsquo;s the main reason I decided to go with geometry instead of Substance Designer made texture, for example.\nHope you like what you see, feel free to drop a comment. Good night from me!\nGo to next blog entry.\nCommentary from 2023 (polycount) Back when I was making these stone, inclined beds above, I distinctively remember being incredibly worried that what I am creating is crazy amounts of high-poly. That whoever sees my work will see right past me and understand how inexperienced I am because of the high triangle count.\nI could have not been further from the truth (even with that second part above, about being inexperienced, being true back then).\nI can\u0026rsquo;t quote you exact numbers but if memory serves me well, the stones wall prop was sitting around 1,800 - 2,000 tris.\nThat is absolutely acceptable. It is acceptable as a prop tris count now in 2023 and it was back in 2018 too. Not much has changed in the span of those years (well, if we ignore Nanite and the possibilities of UE5 right now, of course\u0026hellip;).\nBut the topic opens up a perfect opportunity to talk about triangle counts and preconceptions (and misconceptions) that fly around in students heads (like mine back then!).\nI will try to keep it short and to the point, so my advise now would be: do not take polycount advise from people who don\u0026rsquo;t know what draw calls or LODs are. Do not take polycount advise from people who will not ask the questions of what the intended game style is and what the main gameplay camera implementation is.\nTruth is you can get away with really high poly budgets for a single object. You can do that because you can then implement a few LODs that load much smaller polycount copies with the player going further away from the object.\nIn a lot of student projects not only are there no LODs in sight, especially in projects that are FPS and would benefit immensely from it, but in most of them the draw calls are an absolute mess as well. As such the performance of their game prototype is dragged down by mostly that: over the roof high amount of draw calls and crazy amount of overlapping dynamic lights.\nNext when inevitably the question pops up, in their prototype, of \u0026ldquo;What is wrong with the performance?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;How do we regain back good performance?\u0026rdquo; lots and lots of inexperienced tutors will take a look at the screen and in a deep, pondering facial expression go: \u0026ldquo;Hmmmm, yes\u0026hellip; your props are way too highpoly and the amount of tris drawn on the screen are too high.\u0026rdquo;. Wrong.\nAnalyze your draw calls first, look at your lights, consider some LODs and only then go cutting big percentages of polycount from objects that are most likely already lowpoly and optimized enough.\nIn Unreal you can open the CMD (using the ¬ key on your keyboard) and type \u0026ldquo;stat scenerendering\u0026rdquo;. A menu will pop up that lists your amount of draw calls. Consider looking into ways to reduce them if they are high.\nAnother very useful command is \u0026ldquo;ProfileGPU\u0026rdquo; that will open you up a much more detailed screen where you can see a breakdown of how much resources go where in ms.\nReading all of those is crucial for understanding better what the culprit of your performance is.\nIf you want to read more about draw calls (though not a technical guide by any means) you can do so over at blog entry 6 of this project where in my 2023 update I talk about it.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-11-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-010/cover010_hu65bd5ab5a07c6b61fa3aa43b03f539cd_393251_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-010/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 10 - Wall Props"},{"content":"Revamp. Back to basics. If there is one thing that painting and illustration has taught me better than any anything else, it\u0026rsquo;s the fact that sometimes you can feel in your gut that there is a problem in your composition, but you cloud your mind and decide to ignore it because of fear of failing in trying to fix it. The truth in nearly 10 out of 10 cases, though, is that if you put the time in and you do not ignore it, there is no chance you will not succeed in improving it.\nIn this environment, I could feel the square, too perfect shape. I thought that it fits nicely a shrine, or a temple like that. According to my research, in Japan they did build them in that fashion quite frequently. But that does not change the fact, that no matter what angle I would take with my camera, most of the shots were way too flat and kind of boring.\nSo I went in and used to my advantage the modularity of my props. I left the two main buildings elevated, but took the square hut and shrine down one level. I did that in hopes of capturing more dynamic shots with more interesting silhouettes and better shapes.\nI feel like it did improve quite a bit, and although I will still be posting shots capturing the whole place, I am going to stick to some specific angles and work on what is seen in them.\nThe textures you see for the landscape are placeholders (kind of obvious when you take a look at those roughness channel values).\nIn my very first post I mentioned that I have a special idea for the square hut. I finally went in and blocked it. I want it to look like the workshop of a master calligrapher. All around on the walls and the entrance are hanging countless of scrolls with all sorts of fortunes written in beautiful calligraphy. It needs lots of work but I will try to keep it relatively simple and give it more detail with the scrolls. A good friend of mine from Japan will help me put some proper sentences and texts on those.\nI placed some tiny lamps on the shrine, but the idea is that they will be candles put in bamboo sticks cut at a sharp angle. I blocked out a few shapes in front of it. One will be a trough and the ones next to it will be vases, plants and some statues at the very front.\nGif We haven\u0026rsquo;t had a GIF for a while so here is one as usual. Starting from the beginning.\nI hope you do agree that there is an improvement. I want to thank a few friends that gave me the valuable feedback of saying that the place was looking a bit too flat, even though I had it elevated and every single building was on a different construction level as well.\nI have a few important props still missing, but I will get right to modelling those and then I will try to focus on getting finalized textures and models. I created a cobblestone material, which I still haven\u0026rsquo;t implemented in the scene.\nAny comments are appreciated.

It has been more a process of exploration and learning of lots of things I had to go through. I started sculpting a Foo Dog, or what they call in Japan, a Komainu.\nThe best part of it, in my opinion at least, is that statues like those which are actually old, fall in a weird, soft \u0026ldquo;uncanny valley\u0026rdquo; territory. Sculptors that made them obviously did the best they could for their time. Do you know whose else\u0026rsquo;s work falls in a category like that? Well, mine does. See, I don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience sculpting. But because I am making something \u0026ldquo;ancient\u0026rdquo;, I can get away with having weird proportions here and there. Although I did try to keep most of it appropriate.\nPoor guy is still missing detail on his paws, but I\u0026rsquo;ll spend some time on that before I bake him. His backside also looks a bit like a squirrel, but its an improvement from the look of a incapacitated rabbit that he had at first.\nI might leave him looking a bit weird like that, because I can get away with it as of the aforementioned reasons. It might even add that extra charm and mystique to it.\nHe was the lesser of my problems though. I started doing textures for the ground, and sadly I still don\u0026rsquo;t have anything to show although I did quite a bit of work. I did realize a lot of stuff though, and it keeps me positive that when I continue with it in the next days, I should have some successful materials.\nI did a quick ordinary stone texture. Something to add to my library as I don\u0026rsquo;t want to use any of the Painter defaults.\nI also exposed all of the values - hue, saturation and value + some parameters for how much and deep the cracks are. Should be quite useful and a lot of models that call for stone materials are waiting for me anyway. I will do a moss now and mix the two.\nHere is another model. A detail, as I badly need those at this point, my scene is quite empty.\nThose big twisty bits and the things underneath them that look like bells right now, are made out of hay. Everything is tied together with ropes and looks quite immense and amazing to be fair. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t pass on having something like that. Gonna bake it on a lower poly model and do the hay in Substance Designer.\nLet me show you the reference.\nAnd as a final thought, today I started some foliage. I am doing a bamboo-like plant. I keep calling it bamboo, but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t. Its supposed to have thinner branch and lots of leaves that are more circular and spread out. Doing that in Maya, the leaves in Zbrush and then all baked and textured in Substance Designer (Thanks a lot to Karen Stanley for her insightful tutorials. You are a life saver!):\nPreview screenshot from the engine And this is how it looks in the engine, although it is by no means final:\nWhat do you think about it guys?\nAlso, for those of you who who made it through this long and boring blog post, and are reading this, I have a question. This foliage left me puzzled, as I haven\u0026rsquo;t really done any before\u0026hellip; Could you tell me how you do yours, guys? How do you put it in the engine and what options look the best? See, at the end, I left the mesh (imported and used as foliage with the foliage brush) to be dynamic. Leaving it to static, and baking lightmaps, at no matter what resolutions, produced a cluster of black rigged edges. No matter the size. Feels like increasing the resolution of the lightmap even makes it worse (does not make any sense).\nThe scene is quite empty yet, I haven\u0026rsquo;t placed many pieces of foliage at all, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been really smart with my lightmaps resolutions so far. Not being able to bake this as static makes no sense.\nThanks a lot.

Mainly because I was pretty confident that I know how I want them and it wont take that much to do them. Was I right? Well it took me 3-4 different iterations of doing the same balcony before I settled down on what I like, so maybe I wasn\u0026rsquo;t right after all. But I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you what - it felt refreshing and nice to do it after falling in the hole of \u0026ldquo;oh is this texture worth anything\u0026rdquo; yesterday and the day before that.\nProps are still placeholders and some lack textures. Then there is the very long roof which is 3 shrunk huge roofs and thus the baked AO that has left marks as if from burnt. The bits that are not textured though I even UV mapped so it should be relatively quick to give them the wooden look.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still working on the texture of the roof that you see on the big one. First version was very grey and dark, then I went into more of a brown warm wood look which helped a lot. The bits on the very top are gonna be metal and have oxidized green parts (bronze) that I hope will contrast nicely with the wood. Still I feel like it lacks a bit of variation and texture and as such I will go over the edges and add metal ornaments/rain plates and so on, that will hopefully break up the wood and make it more interesting.\nHere is an ordinary wood planks texture I did in Substance Designer to go on the walls:\nAt first I though it was very boring and dull and is gonna look bad in Unreal. Turns out that wooden walls are very much ordinary, and maybe its for the best not to have anything crazy going on. I think i will leave it like that for now, see how it works with the metal and with the rest of the textures in the scene, and then maybe come back to it and add detail, make it actually realistic or completely change it.\nGif time The GIFs remind me of one last thought that I have about my scene development. Most of the angles I show in the GIFs have the thinking of \u0026ldquo;what would be the best angle to fit everything in the picture and show my progression in the most transparent way\u0026rdquo;. Thus the far-away aerial shots from some of the previous posts. What I really should do soon though, is pick some specific angles that look good and make the scene justice. Then I will have to stick to those and make sure they above all look the best so I can use them as final images.\nThe idea behind my whole level and development here is that I want the scene to have a \u0026ldquo;game ready\u0026rdquo; look, where if you throw the player in, no matter First or 3rd Person, they can traverse anywhere and everything will look perfect from any angle. Will that work though? I might have to accept the fact that I might not be able to do that for the short deadline we have. Not with the quality that I want anyway. And if that is the case, then I need to have proper angles and bits where I can fall back to and know that they will work.\nFor now though, I\u0026rsquo;m sticking to the \u0026ldquo;game ready\u0026rdquo; mentality, no matter the size.\nAs always, comments are much appreciated and have a good night from me.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-007/cover007_huebea0764ca23dde451486ad2fbfc7ae8_198392_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-007/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 07 - Bits and Pieces"},{"content":"Lights In Yesterday, I modelled some hanging lanterns. I really needed to put some object that cast actual interesting light in my scene so I can start thinking about my light scenario. It\u0026rsquo;s still in the early stages and looks patchy in the sense of having a lot at of light at one place and then none at others, but I\u0026rsquo;ll be working on it more.\nToday I sculpted a bit more the landscape around the place. I also scattered a lot of placeholders for the trees. It changed the mood of the whole place immediately in a way that I really like. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to look into how I\u0026rsquo;m going to make the trees and what to do with my mountains in the distance (they are just placeholder big boulders for now). I\u0026rsquo;m open to any suggestions and tips when it comes to creating the landscape guys!\nBut back to the lanterns, they were kind of very fun to do. Their process was interesting to say the least. Right now they are an Actor (Blueprint) attached with a rope and a Physics Constraint. That way I can apply physics to them and use Impulse to add force and nudge them in one direction. Gives them a slight animation and it makes such a big difference!\nWhile making them, I had to explore how the Physics Blueprints work in Unreal as I had never used them before. It produced an interesting result. Just when I thought that none of the Blueprints worked even the slightest, I looked up and saw a few lanterns suspended in the air, rotating around as if in zero G.\n(YouTube video embedded above. Shows a hanging lantern that is suspended in open air and floats around as if the place has zero gravity.)\nI have them working now, and its something that I believe will add quite a bit to my scene when it comes to the final rendering videos. Also now I know how to do stuff like that for any other object I might want to implement that could be moving. Only thing left now is to actually texture those lanterns.\nAs in my every post, its time for a GIF now I had to change the fog once again in order to make the \u0026ldquo;trees\u0026rdquo; in the distance appear lighter and thus look even further away. The fog changed how my roofs look though, made them maybe too light for my liking. The Volumetric Fog and Atmosphere actors are things I will have to tweak a lot more before I get to what I imagine, but at least there is progress.\nThat will be from me tonight guys, have a good one.\nGo to next blog entry.\nCommentary from 2023 (draw calls tips) I wanted to quickly drop a few words about some of the things I showcase above.\nKnowing what I know now, in 2023, compared to back in 2018, I would not approach making these lanterns with Physics Components at all.\nIt is fun to experiment with Physics Components in Blueprints. If you have not had the chance to do so before, make sure to try as I think there is plenty to learn. There is something I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about back then though, and it\u0026rsquo;s a fundamental part of Tech Art and of creating optimized, real time scenes.\nThat is draw calls.\nFor Physics to work, we need to make the lanterns mesh \u0026ldquo;Movable\u0026rdquo; as opposed to \u0026ldquo;Static\u0026rdquo;. The moment we do that, we separate that piece of geometry in its own draw call.\nLets run a hypothetical situation:\nWe leave the lantern static - like ordinary geometry.\nWe scatter 10 copies of it near one another.\nThen we make sure the material used on all 10 copies is identical.\nOn the scaling options of each we leave it to 1;1;1 on the x;y;z scale.\nA great thing happens; the moment those 10 lanterns get to render on the screen they batch into a single draw call. This keeps it all more optimized.\nIf we are in a blank scene and we render 10 lanterns in 1 draw call as opposed to 10 lanterns in 10 draw calls, we might not feel much of a difference, even if we inspect the fps / ms and profile the entire scene both GPU and CPU wise.\nImagine increasing up the numbers and putting 100-200 even 1000 of these lanterns on the screen. Suddenly rendering all in 1 draw call as opposed to 1000 draw calls can be felt. Then add up all kinds of other art assets on the screen, some static, some movable. Add a bunch of fog cards and alpha card effects that are overdrawing the screen. Add lots of AI running on the CPU. Add some particles, doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you pick to scale them onto the CPU or the GPU. Suddenly you get the typical amount of things happening in a usual game world in a big AAA title. Your performance will then be low, if you were to render these lanterns in 1000 draw calls instead of 1 draw call.\nThe lesson here being that we always need to consider clean practices of putting in art meshes so they end up as optimized and bundle in draw calls as possible.\nI can hear you wondering, though, how are we to then make these lanterns move and look interesting? Without dirtying up our draw calls?\nSome might suggest doing a bespoke bone animation and then attaching it to the lantern. We animate it in Blender or Maya and import in Unreal. But that will have the same culprit of an issue as above. Animated assets with bones of their own most of the time end up as separate draw calls (there are ways to overcome that and still keep bone animations but that is for another blog).\nAs such a better way instead would be to ask the following. Is there a way I can bundle all of this movement onto the GPU? When you ask that question the follow up conclusion would be: yes! You can. Through a material shader perhaps? That\u0026rsquo;s on the GPU, right?\nAbsolutely. If we create this entire animation of moving the lantern in some direction, as if slightly moved by wind, inside the shader, then it means the geometry when placed in the world can remain Static. When it remains static it means our draw calls are back to being easier to manage.\nMy suggestion for getting that done would be to 0.0.0 your pivot point of the mesh to where the upper cable of the lantern is. Export like that and put into Unreal. In a special material shader for the lantern then, create a World Position Offset (WPO) that slightly rotates everything in whichever axis you like. If you add a little Sine animation multiplier to that, inside the WPO numbers, you will get exactly a bit of movement as if pushed by the wind. Apply that to all other lanterns now and they will all bundle into draw calls, as long as using the same material and their scale in the world is similar.\nIf you dislike the lantern movement being similar between all of them, you could introduce a bit of a random number multiplier in the shader to overcome it. Or you could expose a number that controls it, and in a material instance of the original parent put in your own animation offset as a number.\nIf you do that second option though, consider making just 3-4 material instances and then applying them to your 300-400 lanterns in the scene so they all end up in 3-4 draw calls. If you go out of your way to make a unique instance for each lantern then we are back to square one and we end up with all of them having a unique draw call (kind of bad).\nI know I quickly gloss over the last few tips, but I intend to give you the names of the techniques and resources you could look up online and I believe you can accomplish whatever it is you imagine using that. The tricky part is knowing, and being aware of it all in the first place.\nThat is the part I struggled with the most before I joined the industry professionally. At my university for 3 years course not once were the words \u0026ldquo;draw calls\u0026rdquo; mentioned. When people talked about optimization everyone jumped to \u0026ldquo;oh well, its just too highpoly\u0026rdquo;. Though even back then I knew that clearly is not the case, it still took me years before I first realized about draw calls.\nQuite honestly, being in the industry now, I will tell you that even some professionals go for years unaware about draw calls. They talk and talk about lowpoly and highpoly but never consider their draw calls or implementing LODs to increase performance. But this would be a conversation for another time.\nAs for now, if you are a student or someone getting into things just now, and in this blog you for the first time came across the concept of draw calls, then I take it this was helpful and the idea of it leaves me happy. Now go on and look up some more engine docs and videos on draw calls and supplement and increase your knowledge even more!\nPete.\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/cover006_huabafe3b2e7450d684bce54a0e7ec3069_227800_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 06 - Lamps"},{"content":"Work fom yesterday and today Yesterday, I started texturing. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t planing on starting this soon, but I wanted to have a preview of what is to be. I also knew that I will go for a pipeline that I haven\u0026rsquo;t mastered before, so I wanted to make sure I can do it properly. I started with objects I have the exact dimensions of. That is the wooden supports that go around the place to create the \u0026ldquo;scaffolding\u0026rdquo;.\nThis is the result:\nI knew that I wanted a wooden texture, but to be fair I imagined I will need to do a detailed pass of Substance Designer and then use that in Painter to layer out more finished non-tillable texture feel.\nInstead, I got the object in Zbrush, did a high-poly detailed sculpt of it and then baked it on low poly. I then layered a few colors together using the Curvature mask that Substance Painter bakes. The result is what you see, and to be honest I am pretty happy with it. If I manage to give everything else the same level of detail, I reckon it should be good.\nAs you can see in the image above, I modelled the basic shapes of the house a bit more. It got me, to what looks like in Maya, a Hansel and Gretel House. Note, I\u0026rsquo;ve marked with reddish color, shapes that don\u0026rsquo;t matter. What is white, is the shapes I need to bake and texture and then repeat to get the rest (the roof of course will be a piece of its own, with and UV of its own).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working with modular pieces quite a bit (as seen in the wooden supports). I realized that I can do much more with less models than I imagined at first. After I learned my lesson with the wooden supports, I made sure to make the most out of the shapes I create with the house models.\nAs always, lets do a GIF! My favorite. Note, I haven\u0026rsquo;t put much work into the lighting scenario. I am really happy with the modular pieces though, because they are really low poly and I managed to get the most out of them by baking.\nYou can see them laid out here:\nWhat I did is two big pieces (a part from the very small one) I modelled those those out - sculpted them in high detail - and then baked. Then I cut the pieces in the very middle. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have to do any changes on the UV or textures. I managed to get 2 extra pieces out of one sculpt. And that did make quite the big difference. Using those, I could manage to recreated and replace all of the basic brushes in Unreal.\nSomething else - quite obvious but still - a cube (or parallelepiped) has 4 sides. If you sculpt and bake those properly, you can rotate the same object each time you repeat it and get enough variation out of it!\nI\u0026rsquo;m gonna texture the new pieces I did for the main buildings soon (the emissive windows and etc.) and I hope it looks good. I\u0026rsquo;ll share all of the results with you.\nGood night from me, and I hope you are doing great!\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-10-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-005/cover005_hu9c59cfe770ca2c80e7ab1f3e812a21ef_143655_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-005/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 05 - Hansel and Gretel"},{"content":"Work from today and yesterday In general I\u0026rsquo;ve been going around and replacing Unreal basic brushes with proper models.

I started doing that in Maya, modelling them in such a way that they are good enough to be turned into high-poly, then baked and textured. I\u0026rsquo;ll add more detail on them before I do that of course, but its nice to finally see them in and realise what silhouettes the buildings create.\nAnd here is a GIF:\nThey are really smooth and lack any tiling mainly because I imagine them to be from wood. The reference I am looking at in this case, is the Izumo Taisha Shrine:\nI\u0026rsquo;ll replicate the texture in Substance Designer later on use it on the roofing. My only consideration is that they might be left looking a bit bare and not finished at the end. I think it has to do with the fact that, when we talk about Japanese or Chinese buildings of this style, we always imagine one covered in numerous pretty, circular tiles. As such by the end I might collide a few different styles and end up with something of my own.\nHere is a close up of the work Any comments are much appreciated. Good night from me guys!\nGo to next blog entry.\n","date":"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/cover003_huc8a1684a8249e96f27ff3bf732fb6070_201474_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-003/","title":"The Animal Shrine - 03 - Roof"},{"content":"Greyboxing I\u0026rsquo;ve been greyboxing the concept for my level for a few hours now. I\u0026rsquo;m quite excited how its shaping already and wanted to update all of you with some screenshots.\nA few days ago I did a sketch on paper looking at the level top-down. In that one, I made every single shape and the buildings square. Today, playing with the shapes in Unreal, I decided that I want to break up the level a bit more than that.\nI wanted to be sure that there is variety in height too, and as such I elevated the whole place. I created wooden structures for each building to sit on. I still don\u0026rsquo;t have the roofs, and I don\u0026rsquo;t think its much worth it to even greybox them in Unreal. Making them to look like anything, even for illustrative purposes, will take far too long, and now that I have figured most of the measurements I can just dive into Maya and make them there.\nThe fencing around the whole place will be from stone. It will also have its own mini triangular roofing that is probably gonna be wooden (in the style of the rest of the buildings). For the square building to the right I have an interesting idea, but I will share it with you given that everything else goes according to plan the next few weeks.\nHere are some progress GIFs:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s kind of fun to see it get built like this in an animation, as if some invisible workers are putting it in place.\nAn angular shot for a better view:\nAnd here is an aerial shot:\nFurther work I\u0026rsquo;m imagining prolific and bulky (but smooth) triangular roofs that go on 2 or even 3 levels. I think they will compliment the squarish shapes underneath and create some interesting silhouettes.\nAround the whole place I want to scatter lots of trees, as to make this whole place in a remote, tranquil location. In one of the reference books that I got, the author put it so nicely in words, that its quite the inspiration for me \u0026ndash; \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;the plains would have formed a veritable sea of trees, their tips stretching into the distance like waves.\u0026rdquo;\nWell, given technical limitations on the number of trees I can have and also the fact that I\u0026rsquo;ve never done a serious foliage before, let alone a tree, we shall see if I manage to accomplish view worthy of that description. But that is something for the very end, and as such not worth any worry right now.\nI hope that you like what you see and that your projects are coming along nicely guys!

As such I decided not to use any art from the Environment Design category. I gathered some images and put them in one sheet in order to have the basic mood and ideas there.\nGiven that I\u0026rsquo;m not using any concept pieces, I was worried that I might struggle a bit. As such yesterday I visited my University\u0026rsquo;s library in order to do some research and get some books on the topic. I borrowed 3 books on the topic as you can see below.\nBooks Reading about the different buildings will help me immensely, as I feel like I need to know their purpose, not only their visual appearance.

Christina Vangou and Charlie Critchley. Time was very limited on this project, and we had to create everything from scratch. No use of already made asset packs.\nWhat you see is a tiny corner of a much bigger space base. This corner is the one where we got to finish and fully texture and model out though, and as such I am showing this to you.\nThe project was Virtual Reality based, and although we did put quite a bit of time on a few different game mechanics and puzzles, we don’t have the resources right now to record a VR gameplay and showcase it.\nI hope you still find interesting what you see. I know I had a blast working on it (especially coming up with this custom material shader for the hologram).\nHere are a few screenshots from the whole place.\nWe came up with the idea that you could pick up a pair of yellow goggles. That would enable you to press a key to put them on. Looking through them would show you writings on the walls, numbers on the hologram planets and so on. Things that would not be visible with the naked eye.

After all, thanks to them she was able to connect. A glimpse into so many minds, that every synapse in her brain was firing. A feeling of ecstasy caused by the chemical reactions. It was real. More real than anything she had experienced before. A true connection. But with whom? Or even, with what?\nThis piece is a special one for me. I put a lot into it and it is not my ordinary scary, monstrous art. And that is why I love it. Took nearly 30 hours which is the piece I have worked the longest so far.\nI hope you do enjoy it as much as I do. Make sure to check out the time-lapse painting (just scroll down and you will see it). Thanks!\nVideo Process The Making of “Drone of Clouds and Minds” - Time-lapse Painting\nHere is a link to the video of the making of my last painting.\nWhen I publish my paintings, I always feel the urge to write and explain how and why I went down the path I did with the creation process. Most social medias don’t give you that opportunity though. Also, sadly, most people run around and are so busy these days that I just cant see myself intriguing anyone to sit down and read a piece of writing. No matter if it takes just 5 or 10 minutes, sometimes even less.\nBuilding a following is also hard and I don’t know if this is the place where people are interested in the insights of a struggling artist. But anyways, here it goes (if you like what I say and would like to see it integrated in the video itself next time, do say so please).\nCreation Process I had a university drawing assignment calling for the creation of a character. Well no, this here is not the character that I created for university. What I handed in was a half-assed magician with a robe and very broad shoulders. But one of the initial ideas I had with him was: I wanted him to hold a magical fire. And I wanted it to be something interesting, something novel. So I thought, why not follow some mathematical shapes? Maybe he is a wizard that knows every secret of this world? And he resides in a world, where, though predominantly fantastical, science still exists. Who knows, if they had a scientist good enough, they could probably formulate magic itself too.\nThat’s why I said - well, his fire will have a three dimensional shape that is a bit more unorthodox. He will be holding a fire that is an polyhedron. Maybe icosahedron? 20 faces. That didn’t matter at the time. I even wanted it more abstract.\nSome polyhedrons can be seen above. I especially liked the one numbered 8.\nThis concept stuck with me, but I wanted to explore it in a personal painting, and not something related to university. Here came another idea, one that I had circling in my mind for the prior 4-5 months. A portrait of a woman looking directly into an abstract shape. As such this sketch was born:\nYou can see how it started loosing its mathematical concept and went more into an abstraction. The days that followed though, I had doubts whether I want to be exploring something as abstract or not.\nIn Diablo 3, the Wizard had some incredible held in off-hand sources and orbs. And although its been very long since I last played, I think that some of the electric colors and interesting shapes had an influence on me too.\nOne of the off-hands in Diablo 3. While painting I didn’t use any of this as a reference, but I believe the game had left a mark on my mind.\nCall me cynical, but a lot of art will circle around and become famous for just being a tiny bit abstract but immensely pretty. There is nothing wrong with it, but I just think people are prone to easily liking stuff that is just pretty and nothing else. Sometimes there even isn’t any deeper meaning into it. I wanted a beautiful painting (for a change in my ordinary monstrous portfolio) but I wanted more than that into it. So I started exploring the idea of a robot. Or a drone.\nOne of the first sketches of the drone. It ended up looking totally different, but you can see the starting points and similarities.\nBut all of that you can see in the video itself. Also, this blog post already stretched to be a bit too lengthy, so I will leave the rest of the insights for the video itself.\nAs always, you can follow my art at Artstation or follow me here and at Twitter.\nHope you found this post interesting, Pete.\nCommentary from 2023 As you can see in the title of the article above, I created this painting back in 2017. It still holds a special place in my heart and I think I learned a few things whilst making it.\nThere are some parts of it that I\u0026rsquo;m no longer really satisfied with as well. The months after I created this illustration I revisited it and slightly positioned the right eye of the character better on her face, fixing it all up a bit.\nI remember I really struggled with another thing in this artwork back then. It\u0026rsquo;s her skin. The tone and the texture of it. I remember the issue lingering on the back of my mind way back then when I was painting it. I think I gave my best shot at trying to overcome it. Now looking at it through the lenses of time, I don\u0026rsquo;t really think I managed to.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t have the interest of painting on top of it once again, 6 years later. I believe it would be more productive, and kind of cooler, if I were to take the character and completely repaint / remake them in the skill set I have now. Into a brand new composition. If I\u0026rsquo;ll ever get into doing that though, I am doubtful.\nYet I wanted to describe what I would do differently, knowing what I know now, with the hopes that perhaps it could be intriguing. Or useful to any 2D artist out there reading this right now and analyzing my artistic process.\nIf I were to rework this painting I would restructure her skin quite a bit more. Right now her skin is very smooth and very perfect. To the point of looking flat, unrealistic and inhuman. She looks like instead of skin she has plastic or some other porcelain. Like a robot.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost like from the picture cover of a magazine promoting unrealistic skin products. Where you look at it and you go \u0026ldquo;wow, ye, that is certainly air brushed to death in Photoshop. No way a real human skin looks like that.\u0026rdquo;\nI think we, humans, have lots of imperfections that make us\u0026hellip; perfect. They make us beautiful. I feel like my painting lacks exactly that.\nSissy Spacek Portrait Few years after painting this, even though I had started heavily into 3D and had made my mind up to pursue a career as an Environment Artist for games, instead of a 2D artist, I did a study. That study was a painting of Sissy Spacek, playing Ruth Deaver in the TV-Show Castle Rock. She was stunning. Her performance left such a heavy impression on me that I just had to paint her. (You can find that here).\nPerhaps just by looking at that painting above, you can see where I am going. With it I actually learned how to through simple brushstrokes capture skin imperfections. I also left lots of brush marks on her skin, instead of smoothing it all out. If my painting above, the Drone one, had some of that going on, I think the portrait would come much more alive.\nAI Art The other thing I would have to mention, given its 2023 now that I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, is AI art. I first hand observed, like all of you, the rise of AI generated imagery. Even few years ago, before it went as mainstream as it is right now, I knew its possible and I knew its under development. I closely followed it because of my love for tech and programming.\nThe first time I saw impressive results from it was after my favourite artist James Gurney started sharing some on his Twitter. Around early 2020. Someone had taught an abstract model on his paintings. He, like many of us, at the first appearance of AI images, was amazed by it. Empowered. Not looking into the nasty restructuring and elimination of human jobs it would scatter through the years to follow. Not realizing the utter spam it would produce, the perfect copy, utter soulless, devout of creativity \u0026ldquo;art\u0026rdquo; spam.\nI am quote honestly overwhelmed from the utter amounts of lacking creativity ai imagery that has overflow everywhere. My fascination for tech and the programming side of it has washed away. The novelty of it has disappeared and I clearly see mostly the rat race it has exacerbated. I could write and write about it, and perhaps I will, but in another post, not now.\nFor now, I just wanted to mention it in order to set the tone and picture of where I am going with this:\nThe masses of spam of uncreative AI art has made me see thousand of images of the same perfect, robot like, chick. Just the same way everything gets spammed with Joker AI art. I won\u0026rsquo;t go into analyzing why that is, but you can perhaps guess.\nWith that being here now, it has distorted my view of my painting above. It has made the perfect, plastic like skin even worse looking that it even did back before AI images. The red shade lipstick, perhaps as well.\nThat is not a problem of my painting per say, but I thought its interesting how the times changed the past few years and how our perception has moved on as well. I had to mention it. I had to tell you. Because every time I see my painting now, AI has left a mark on me and I go \u0026ldquo;oof, that cliché woman again\u0026rdquo;.\nHorizon Influence Back on a more positive, quick note:\nI wanted to also mention that even though back in 2017, when I was painting the \u0026ldquo;Drone of Clouds and Minds\u0026rdquo;, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have any screenshots of \u0026ldquo;Aloy\u0026rdquo; from \u0026ldquo;Horizon Zero Dawn\u0026rdquo; used as a reference. And even though I didn\u0026rsquo;t play the game back then, I still remember watching a quick playthrough of the first hour or so of the game.\nI believe, now, that Aloy left such a big impression on my mind back then, that perhaps unconsciously she was the big inspiration behind the painting.\nRight now, as of writing this and creating this blog website in 2023, I actually finally, with years delay, got to play Horizon Zero Dawn. I got into the PC port release of it. It\u0026rsquo;s an absolute blast and an amazing game. Inspires me in so many ways.\nHow all of this lined up, and I ended up writing about this painting just as I am playing the game, I find a bit funny. I hope you enjoyed reading all of this.\nPete.\n","date":"2017-05-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/peteDimDrone_huce27e407d8dbd6cd38de6b62c04ba3eb_515780_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://petedimitrovart.com/p/drone-clouds-minds/","title":"Drone of Clouds and Minds"}]
