&lt;p&gt;This page details and examines the creation of one of my projects called &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Apexis Mage Tower&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. The artwork is a &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; styled diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page examines all aspects of the making of this environment. It first starts from the reference gathering and the ideas behind the tower. It then explores some of the motivation and personal story as to why I decided to create WoW fan art in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, after the reference gathering, we look at the initial blockouts and the sketching of ideas in 3D. From there, we move into Unreal Engine 5 and set up the scene and begin importing the different 3D models and modular pieces. As a step after, we look at Zbrush and Substance Painter and the process of creating WoW styled, hand painted models and their textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun creating this and I hope that reading this gives you ideas and moves you to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a look at the finished result. The artwork is not complete, there will be more work, but this is the stage we are at right now:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;A UE5 screenshot showing a blue background on which a green land mass sits. On top of that is a tower with golden trims. It has three spires that float. Each is colored differently in blue, pink and orange. Those represent colors of the specializations of the Mages in World of Warcraft. The props seen in this shot still lack texture work. They consists of basic, placeholder, colored materials.&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;personal-story&#34;&gt;Personal Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World of Warcraft is a big reason, if not the main reason, that many years ago I got into game art and game development. In an upbringing and childhood full of its usual hard moments &lt;em&gt;(the likes of one we all have)&lt;/em&gt;, I had at least the privilege to have a parent who always encouraged me to pursue my interest and play as many video games, as often as I wished. That is even if back in those years, around her, all other parents looked down on computer games and their &lt;em&gt;influence&lt;/em&gt; on children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom not only believe these games are beneficial and foster creativity, but she also spend the time to play them together with me and my brother. As such, it was only natural that what at first was just gaming soon grew into interest of how these games are made. It further took me down the path of art and ultimately lead me where I am now as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama013.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;A close up of the image seen in the previous paragraph. It depicts the bright tower now seen from a zoomed UE5 camera. The floating spires have a glow VFX that fits their colors. From this angle the orange one - related to fire magic - is seen. The Apexis crystals are also moving upwards the facade of the building. They have a placeholder green, teal color, and for now still lack the Apexis textures.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am frankly surprised that after all these years I have never sat down to create a stylised art scene. More specifically in the visual style of games like World of Warcraft. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that will change now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the making of this diorama, I will be using Blender, Unreal Engine 5, Zbrush, Substance Painter and Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;video-devlog&#34;&gt;Video Devlog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was writing this blog post, I also started making a YouTube video that goes over lots of what is written here. If you wish, you can watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4E2c6NbD-8&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Title is &#34;Making a 3D Diorama in UE5 - Apexis Mage Tower&#34;. The video shows me talking in front of a camera, explaining a lot of the aspects we go over here. There are also lots of time-lapses and extra footage. If interested, give it a watch.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the written format as a medium, which is why I create these blogs here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some moments, there are time-lapses and sped up footage of my art pipeline that would be challenging to showcase or write in detail. As such, after reading the blog post, if you wish to see much more about the Apexis Mage Tower project, give the video above a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reference&#34;&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I knew my next project will be a WoW inspired diorama &lt;em&gt;(fan art)&lt;/em&gt;, I was left with the question of what exactly will this scene depict? Will it be a building? A small encampment in open air? Perhaps an interior instead? Color choice, mood and lighting? What expansion from the game will be its main influence?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before deciding onto a Mage Tower, I actually first went after a tower dedicated to some of the professions in World of Warcraft. My pick was Alchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/alchemyimg.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A screenshot from WoW that showcases an Alchemy profession table. Those are the ones that were introduced into the game in Dragonflight. Image shows a bunch of lowpoly, hand-painted wooden table props. On top of them sit potions, vials and other alchemy 3D assets. They are colored in green, blue, yellow and purple.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;373px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after exploring alchemy, one of my friends - Oliver - did a paint over onto one of my screenshots of my tower. He then gave me the idea to go for a Mage tower. We will take a look at the concept art he created a bit further into the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set off to gather different screenshots from the game and get some ideas. I went down a path that ultimately revealed additional concepts and inspired me to pick &amp;ldquo;Apexis&amp;rdquo; crystals as a motive in the visuals of the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mage-tower&#34;&gt;Mage Tower&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought my first influence would be that it would be fun to create a mage tower. That would be the type of building I go for. In my mind&amp;rsquo;s eye, I immediately saw &amp;ldquo;Khadgar&amp;rsquo;s Tower&amp;rdquo;, hidden between giant mushrooms in Talador. Introduced in the expansion &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Warlords of Draenor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also looked at Dalaran, seen through the expansions. I turned to more modern examples as well. Those are from the recently released expansion &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The War Within&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/warcraft_diorama_reference_001.png&#34;

		alt=&#34;A collage of screenshots from WoW. First column showcases two images that depict Khadgar&amp;rsquo;s tower. It is a large, stone structure, with an elegant roof. Crystals float around it. It&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by large Zangarra mushrooms. Second column shows an image from The War Within depicting tall and medium sized Earthen towers made out of stone. Below it is an image from Dalaran, showing a massive tower with purple crystals. Last two images show a tall and elegant tower with a yellow gem on top that illuminates a dark cavern around it. Those are radiant light towers in the zone Hallowfall.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;589px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent all of these screenshots to Ollie, thinking out loud about my ideas. I then started 3D blocking in Blender. Whilst creating the main shapes of the tower, I got side tracked and thought I could maybe turn the tower into an Alchemy tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whilst I was doing that, Ollie did a paint over on my blockout and he convinced me that I should stick with the more simple, and elegant idea, of going for a Mage Tower instead of Alchemy Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;apexis-crystals&#34;&gt;Apexis Crystals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right from the start I knew that I wanted to have some crystals in my 3D scene. Crystals are incredibly fun to make, as you might have seen me write about over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I flew over Outland and explored every nook and cranny of the floating in space lands there. Among the many pictures I took, the ones that spiked my interest the most were these crystals, seen on the left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/warcraft_diorama_reference_003.png&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image collage that shows four screenshots. First column depicts two screenshots from the zone Netherstorm. It is lots of purple lands that on top have tons of apexis crystals that are shaded in green, teal, turquoise and aquamarine colors. Second column has an image from Legion that shows a ruined zone with lots of purple crystals. The final image shows a zone from War Within that has blue shards and crystals. &#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;159&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(By the way, I swear I very well know how to take screenshots with the UI of the game hidden away! Every reference pic I take is like that. You&amp;rsquo;ve caught me in a rare moment of weakness and some of the pics here include my gorgeous game UI. Enjoy it!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I debated a lot which type, and color of crystal, to go for. After flying through Outland and remembering about Apexis crystals, I opened and read about them further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apexis crystals were created by the ancient Anhari and Skalaxi orders of the Apexis to contain knowledge in lieu of scrolls or tomes, and just touching one is enough to gain the knowledge from within them. It is even possible to see the memories of the one who constructed the crystal. In the slowly expanding Gorian Empire, Apexis crystals became highly prized and eagerly sought out by ogre sorcerers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One configuration of stars causes an unusual vibration in the crystals strewn across Draenor, relics of the ancient Apexis. Some swear that the crystals will multiply when left unattended beneath the night sky, but none have seen the phenomenon firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Apexis_Crystal&#34;&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Wowpedia&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystals that grant you a knowledge written inside them? And they multiply under the night sky? I though this was perfect for my use case, as by then I had already started a little blockout of my scene. I had crawled lots of crystals, as if growing, from a crevice in the ground and up towards the roof of the tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered how I will explain why the crystals grew upwards like that. As such when I read that Apexis crystals were thought to multiply, I decided they were meant exactly for me. The fact that they contain knowledge as well, I believed is a perfect match for the pursuit of knowledge a class like the Mages have.&lt;/p&gt;

The crystals are apexis and their teal and blue tones are in contrast with the starry, purple and red sky of Outland seen behind. The illustration is called Apexis Blast and is from the Ashes of Outland expansion pack of the card game Hearthstone. Illustrator is Tim Shevtsov, 2020.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockout&#34;&gt;Blockout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few hours of sketching my 3D shapes inside of Blender, whilst looking at the WoW tower screenshots, thinking about Alchemy and Mages, I produced this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama000.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A Blender screenshot showing the tower 3D sketch. It has a warm, gray studio light MatCap. The lower body of the tower is mostly blocked out but the upper parts remain very abstract and unrefined.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was starting to shape up nicely. It was a bit abstract - overly abstract - here and there, but for a few hours of work, I was happy with the artistic direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down for some more sketching and refining the next day, and I got to this stage seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama000_02.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The same angle Blender screenshot as before, showcasing the tower. This time the warm gray MatCap has been changed for a cold one. The upper, floating spire shapes have been refined. There are golden trims and blue gems now too.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-art-paint-over&#34;&gt;Concept Art Paint Over&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image is when Ollie finally saw my work. He loved it and his immediate reaction was to ask if I could send him a frontal, 2D, no perspective angle of the tower blockout so far. He wanted to paint on top and give me some ideas and I welcomed that warmly. I knew that my work can only improve with his input and feedback. As such I was thankful he is willing to do that for me.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Frontal angle orthographic view of the Apexis Mage Tower, as seen in Blender. There is a floating spire, a human dummy, and lots of blue color, spiky crystals crawling up its facade. The tower is rather short. There are golden trims blocked out here and there. &#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;full-resolution&#34;&gt;Full Resolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent him the 2D angle of the tower above. Few days later, he came back to me with this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/mage-tower-oliver-harbour.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;A painting of a tower that has three spires. They float and have an egg shape. They are colored orange, blue and purple. There is a magic glow behind each spire. The tower is now much taller, when compared to before. There are more spiky elements on the golden trims, that remind a bit of the towers seen in Dragonflight. Artwork by Oliver Harbour.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Ollie moved further the shape language, the level of detail and the overall concept of the tower. He came up with the idea that the tower could have three floating spires, instead of one. Those would then be dedicated to the different specialization of the Mages in Warcraft. That is Fire, Frost and Arcane. Their respective colors being orange, blue and pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;before-and-after&#34;&gt;Before and After&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is comparison between the two, overlaid on top of one another, with an interactive bar that lets you move and see the before and after result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was refining the shapes of my tower in Blender, I already was getting worried that it might be too short on its height. For a tower, it had started to look a bit small due to that. I made it taller a few times, but it was not enough. When Ollie did the paint over, he increased the height and it was an incredible piece of feedback for me, improving the silhouette a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;World of Warcraft has a very specific visual language. One with bulky shapes and lots of bevels and chisels. I think in my initial art, I hadn&amp;#39;t captured that quite well yet. I needed more refinement and that is something that the concept art addressed really nicely and gave me lots of answers and useful ideas. Watch the YouTube video devlog and you will see me talk about that more in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blender-work-after-the-concept&#34;&gt;Blender Work After The Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set off to use the concept art from Ollie as my main reference now. In a week time, in my spare time outside of my fulltime Rebellion work, I got to this stage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another nearly isometric angle screenshot of the tower, inside Blender. The three floating spires are now in. There are placeholder materials. The crystals are refined and look more mellow, instead of pointed and sharp. The body of the tower is improved and the metal, gold trim shapes from Ollie&amp;rsquo;s concept are in too.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-perspective&#34;&gt;In Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above angle is with a very far-away camera, with low FOV. It forces the perspective out of the shot, but gives me nice visibility. Here is the same stage of art, but seen through a perspective camera:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I had made the tower taller, as per Ollie&amp;rsquo;s concept, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had the chance to get a start on any of the other cool art changes from him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama002_02.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Blender screenshot of the tower. This time around, the camera is closer to it, the FOV is not as small either, and the perspective in the scene is more obvious. The tower is taller and one can see golden trims and blue gems on its facade.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; image, I have refined my shapes and done further prop art and modelling work to get me to what Ollie had painted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama006.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical angle to before. Blender screenshot again. The tower is as tall as before, but the top spires now have an egg shape and are larger. The gold trims are more refined as well.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If the tower appears to get a tiny bit shorter in the second shot - note that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Due to me making it taller, I actually had to move the camera backwards in space, further away from it. I did that because otherwise I could not fit it into the composition. Its top was being cut out of the camera view.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;landscape&#34;&gt;Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the stage above, I was happy with the progress and I moved into sculpting the land further. I did most of it inside Blender&amp;rsquo;s sculpting toolset. You can watch a time-lapse of that in the YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama007.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot of the tower. This time around the previously square plot of land has been pulled around, refined and sculpted. It now looks like twisting, short series of valleys. In front of the tower there is a curved path leading to its entrance.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-unreal&#34;&gt;In Unreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I moved to export pieces into Unreal Engine 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I set up my blank scene, things looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-ue5-000.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1020&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A UE5 screenshot of a blank scene. It has the default blue fog and blue volumetric (ray marched) clouds in the atmosphere. There is the previously seen landscape, but now its refined, has a more curved frontal path and is green. A dark tower sits on top but not all parts are imported yet.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more work, I got to the stage seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-ue5-001.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1020&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE5 angle similar to before but now the volumetric clouds are gone. The scene is taking a turn towards more stylized look. The tower pieces are all imported and the three floating spires can be all seen.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted this to be a diorama. That meant that even though I was really pulled into the idea, and the devil spoke into my ear, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t listen and should NOT go into making a giant, open-world environment map. Instead, I would keep it to a &amp;lsquo;cut&amp;rsquo; of land and a small, manageable portion of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t overscope your art. Don&amp;rsquo;t do a feature-creep, no matter what the devil of over-ambition whispers in your ear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to reflect the above better, I decided to keep the floor and the background into similar hues and have both be a dark value of color. The thinking behind this is that even though the geometry is an island, it would not sit in the sea but instead it would have a 3D cut where the bounds end in flat colors, and the intention is clear that only the diorama part has been refined, no outskirt work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-ue5-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1020&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical UE5 camera angle as before. The bright sky and bright blue fog have now been replaced for darker, more neutral tones. The tower is more refined with teal gemstones crawling up its facade.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step, and next image, would be the one this article started with. It is seen below. It&amp;rsquo;s the stage of the project I am at in this moment of time, as of writing this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama011.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3840&#34;
	height=&#34;2040&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Angle like the previous image. In UE5 we now see the landmass which the tower sits on being more refined. It twists into a knot and has more intricate silhouette than before. In the lower parts of the island there are more crystals placed as well.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see above, that I twisted the land into a knot. I did that because I wanted to give everything a bit more fantastical, and whimsical look. Something to be more exciting but also fit into World of Warcraft better. The flat land that was seen before, was also giving me worries about scale. With things being so flat on it, it looked like it had valleys that would go for kilometers, but that was not the case. As such making some large knots of &amp;ldquo;mountains&amp;rdquo; would give me more opportunity to spice things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images below showcase close up of the tower and we saw some of them at the beginning of the article as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/creating-world-of-warcraft-stylised-art-diorama/peter-dimitrov-wow-diorama013.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Camera zoomed in UE5 and showing a detail of the Apexis Tower facade. On the right is one of the orange spires. It now has some VFX glow planes. Upper one follows the shape of the spire, while a lower part has a Kirin Tor mages insignia symbol which looks like a rune depicting an open eye.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we went over the initial idea for this World of Warcraft stylized diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored the thought process of making it be a Mage tower. Then heading to the idea of it being an alchemy tower. Then, at the end, circled back to Mages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explored different reference gathering in WoW as a game, and references from outside the game too. We took a look at portions of the PureRef moodboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further into it, we looked into initial Blender blockouts and then concept art paint overs on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we moved into importing to Unreal 5 and showcasing the tower inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, we didn&amp;rsquo;t go into nitty gritty details, as this was more an exploration of the art pipeline, than a detailed log of how to do specific elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also looked at a video with some timelapses and further, complimentary explanations about the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-up&#34;&gt;Next Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though this is a World of Warcraft styled diorama, it still is missing a big aspect of the style. That would be the hand painted textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post, we will explore that. We will look at taking some of the tower props into Zbrush. There we will sculpt details and boolean the pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once ready, we will move it back to Blender for by hand retopology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When that is ready, the pieces will be UV mapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After UV mapping, it will be time to take things into Substance Painter and hand paint our World of Warcraft styled textures.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/amarantos026.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 11 - Crystal Prop Breakdown" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the final screenshots of my “&lt;em&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/em&gt;” environment last week. Along with those, I also created some props showcase and breakdown images. In &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt&lt;/a&gt;, I already covered quite a bit of insight and behind-the-scenes early images of how I approached creating the geometry for the Nanite crystal. I also showed many screenshots of the progress on the texturing and my reasoning behind the way I approached it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other ten entries of “&lt;em&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/em&gt;” dev blogs, I showed and told you about everything I wanted when it comes to this project. There are even few parts that are tutorials. As such, I am wrapping up the series. Even though the “Crystal Sculpt” blog above is very detailed, I thought I would create this as a supplement blog to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such if you are interested in creating a crystal prop like it, go over and read entry four, &amp;ldquo;Crystal Sculpt&amp;rdquo;, above and then come back here and complement your knowledge with the additional four image breakdowns on the topic. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s informative and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots&#34;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screenshots of the final result. This is what we will be inspecting a breakdown of in the images to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;breakdown&#34;&gt;Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text and breakdown behind each image is transcribed below &lt;em&gt;(which was another reason I made this blog post - to transcribe the text for better accessibility)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;An image collage with seven images and breakdown text explanations next to each. First image shows an albedo view in Substance Painter. The crystal prop is seen. It consists of a rock ball and attached blue crystals on the south and north pole of the sphere. The next two images showcase the rock ball UVs and next to it the crystals UVs that look like lots of tiny rectangles. Below is an image where the prop is shaded in flat red and flat green. Red is crystal shards, green is the rock orb. The text explanations are transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystal prop has two material IDs. 1/ Red color - crystal shards. 2/ Green color - rock orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither utilize high- to low-poly bake or normal bakes. Both benefit from AO and curvature bake. Those were made by baking “low on low” &lt;em&gt;(in this case we are talking about a dense Nanite mesh)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance Painter work for crystal (red) includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triplanar mapping of some base color noises (the liquid-spill shapes);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hand polish by painting seams and liquid-spill parts that didn’t come out looking detailed even with triplanar mapping;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AO multiplied into the base color for an extra punch of darkness detail;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughness variation derived from AO and curvature bakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance Painter work for crystal (green) includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordinary PBR texturing utilizing normal noise from rock texture, base color, AO and roughness. Blue shards attached to it were masked by hand too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image above then shows a close up of the blue crystal, rendered in UE5. Text next to it reads:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal UVs all point in a uniform direction. That way any tiling detail normals / roughness and other channels used in UE5 would get the best appearance. Texel density is uniform too. UVs were created and polished by hand. Laid out with UV Packmaster 2. (Blender)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final two images in the picture above then show an albedo close up of the patterns painted on the crystal. In the first image there are seams, in the second one they are painted away. Text next to those reads:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before (left) and after (right). An example of a quick by hand painting to improve seams.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Second image collage. On the top right corner is the same red and green mask as before. Below it is a large rendering of the crystal rendered in UE5. It showcases intricate, blue and aquamarine shards. They have splashes of purple and deep sea blue here and there. Next are two images that showcase the UVs as seen before but now rendered in an UE5 shader. Next, to the very right, is a view of both materials properties. That lists lots and lots of parameters like Tiling, Textures, Masks, Opacity, Emission, Normals, Panners, etc. Text is transcribed below.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal material ID (red) seen in this shot &lt;em&gt;(blue image above with white splash in the middle)&lt;/em&gt;. This one is the more detailed and a special one. It tiles a micro and a macro normals as well as a roughness tiled channel. In addition it has two fresnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock orb material ID (green) seen in this shot &lt;em&gt;(gray image above)&lt;/em&gt;. Is ordinary PBR with nothing special going on.&lt;/p&gt;

	height=&#34;2160&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image collage (third one). Here there are 5 purple screenshots. They show different parts of the crystal prop that is now tinted in green and teal hues. The background of the scene is in deep purples. This slide showcases the fresnels used in the shaders. If one zooms close onto the green crystal and compares the different images, the fresnels can be seen giving bright contour and extra dimension to the artwork. Yellow arrows point on a screenshot of the material settings and the different parameters. Text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresnel[1] off (top left). Fresnel[1] on (top right). This is the inverted fresnel. Gives crystal shine from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresnel[2] off (bottom first image in collage above). Fresnel[2] on (bottom second image in collage above). Is not inverted. Has lower power but more obvious color. Gives the colorful edges (noticeable from both close and far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Fresnels add lots of detail. They work especially well with the Nanite geometry. Seen to the left is an edge that exists in the geo but is mostly invisible and flat when colored with only an albedo. When an inverted Fresnel is added, that edge is especially pronounced and gives the visuals more dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Final, fourth, image collage. This one shows three textures. Two are normals and one is linear mask. The first normal map seen has large, macro detail gaussian dots and circular scratches. The second normal map has micro details on it although the shapes seen are much more obvious and are large crystal matrix surface patterns. The black and white, linear mask looks like a gaussian clouds mixed with moisture noise (Substance Designer). All three maps are tiling. Next to each there is explanation, transcribed below. Lastly an image looks at the close up patters of the crystal and explains the emission and animation that goes there (also transcribed below).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-normal-1&#34;&gt;Tiling Normal [1]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first tiled normal detail acts mostly as macro detail. Thats in the form of gaussian dots and circular scratches. They appear large in their shape and tiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-normal-2&#34;&gt;Tiling Normal [2]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second tiled normal detail acts mostly as micro detail. It gives the surface a crystal matrix pattern. It might look large on the left, but you can see on the right that its tiled over 28 times &lt;em&gt;(making it tiny)&lt;/em&gt;. My favourite part with this one is that when the camera goes further away and the texture mipmaps to a lower level, it gives the crystal a dotted, sparking visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-roughness&#34;&gt;Tiling Roughness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in page 1 &lt;em&gt;(thats image one)&lt;/em&gt;, the crystal has unique albedo, roughness and metallic. These are seen here: &lt;em&gt;(green arrow points to albedo and AO_R_M texture slots in the material)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that not only the normals could benefit from tiling noise but that the roughness could get a bit of detail as well. As such this bitmap seen to the left, I multiplied into the AO_R_M of the crystal to give more richness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emission-and-animations&#34;&gt;Emission and Animations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the very top group in the image above you can see lots of parameters relating to emission. They have one underlying design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ In Painter mask parts of the “liquid spill albedo”. Use that as unique “EmissiveMask” above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Tile a big gaussian noise. (EmissivePannerMask)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Pan the noise in U and V direction, giving an animated look. (PanX and PanY Speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are hard to show here and can be observed in the videos &lt;em&gt;(seen in albums below)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artstation-albums&#34;&gt;Artstation Albums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the images above, and many more, in 4k, over at my Artstation. I ended up creating three albums as I could organize the tons of screenshots better that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Shows a UE5 cinematic video. The crystal prop and the environment are part of that.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see some behind the scenes images on the topic of the cinematic over at Hayley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hayleyrumbold.com/theamarantosritual?&amp;#43;=&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four images showed a breakdown of how I accomplished to create a detailed crystal prop inside Unreal 5. The different pieces that make up the final visual were taken apart. Comparison of some effects being on and off were shown. Some of the bitmaps used were also previewed. With all of that, hopefully you learned something new and got ideas and inspiration of how to approach the geometry and texture work when it comes to your own props.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos183-c.png" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 10 - Spiral and Flowers" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;previous-steps&#34;&gt;Previous Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time we took a slight break from the environment art in the &lt;strong&gt;Amarantos Ritual&lt;/strong&gt; series of blogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of looking at props, set dressings and decision making into the scene itself, we took some time to go over a step-by-step guide for the creation of a VFX basin. It now sits right under the crystal in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos184.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1152&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up screenshot from Unreal Engine 5. Shows a circular platform with square cobblestones motive. In the middle there is a gap with a vfx that looks like liquid-metal that is tinted in glowing blues.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed reading about how that VFX was created then you can follow and take a glance &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/vortexvfxindex/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;over here at this page.&lt;/a&gt; The tools used include Unreal, Substance Designer and Blender. The main driving force of the VFX is a polar coordinates distortion of UVs that is seen and widely used in games like Diablo IV, Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate and more. That is something that I showcase with examples from exactly those titles over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 07 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Three&lt;/a&gt;. Take a look if you haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;last-time&#34;&gt;Last Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look away from that VFX and check how the scene looked last time, we can find it in this state:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos068.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another UE5 screenshot. This time its the main camera angle where to the right is the ajar door spilling daylight in an otherwise dark interior space. In the middle, above the circular platform, a crystal floats. Beneath it the basin is empty and there is no VFX yet. The roots crawling around the walls have pod-like, white flowers.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here it is now, with some additions I will go over and describe in this blog entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos183.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot angle identical to before. The door and lighting are the same, but this time around the flowers on the roots are different. Instead of being pod shaped, they are now more like a petal flower. Its blue shape is more saturated than the previous screenshot, but its value and lack of little lights make it blend better. Around the crystal are lots of shards.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the two images above, you can see that I&amp;rsquo;ve build up further, more powerful blue color permeating through the scene. I did that through some light and through some new props and set dressings. Those include wider petal flowers on the vines and roots that crawl the walls. There are also new runes on the top parts of the inner walls and stronger blue symbols in the middle, square, broken pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also made an animated Niagara VFX for shattered shards that spiral endlessly upwards in space. In some of the screenshots I show you might see those off, as I would disabled them here and there when their visual was getting into my way of working. But these were something I made with the intention of keeping at the end in order to give me more interest in the final beauty shots as well as in the cinematic we are creating with Hayley Rumbold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;endless-spiral&#34;&gt;Endless Spiral&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos185.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3124&#34;
	height=&#34;2028&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Lower angle camera shot, close from the ground. It looks up to the open, flower-like ceiling. The blue crystal orb has lots of particles spawned in a spiral going up. They have a blue dot, 2D debug look.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;154&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;369px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got into placing any shard static meshes for my spiral, I wanted to first block out its actual shape. As such in Niagara I started with the default sprite renderer. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the elements spawned were 2D billboards or 3D meshes for now. My advise for approaching any VFX is always to first sketch your spawning and your movement that creates your overall shape. Don&amp;rsquo;t focus on any little details like what is spawned, colors, meshes, rotations of those, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos186.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3124&#34;
	height=&#34;2028&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot angled similar to before, but now the spiral is much more dense and visually busy. This visual of it was the initial one the Niagara had, before tweaks were made to make it look like in the previous image.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;154&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;369px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one above, a dense spiral, quite more visually busy than the image before, is what I had right at the start. Blocking it out made me realize I want the spiral to be less dense which meant it needed to be more skewed in Z upwards space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;glitched-look&#34;&gt;Glitched Look&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos188.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1227&#34;
	height=&#34;996&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A closer look camera shot. This time around the blue dots are replaced for a 3D shard. That shard has identical appearance to all others spawned next to it, making it look glitched and broken. Like as if a mesh started moving in space but a ghost of it was left behind multiple times. UE5 screenshot.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;123&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;295px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only after I had the main spiral shape, I started trying to put in static meshes instead of the 2D blue dots. This screenshot above showcases the very first go where I had still not randomized the shard, its scale and its rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos189.png&#34;
	width=&#34;845&#34;
	height=&#34;1140&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Portrait framed screenshot that looks at the spiral being much wider than the previous screenshot. The shards still spawn at the same rotation and location, and the lower parts of the spiral has a heavy, glitch appearance. Like a Windows XP window that has crashed.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;74&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;177px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to tweak the mesh spawner so it follows the spiral a bit better &lt;em&gt;(seen above)&lt;/em&gt;. Yet it was still not great and I started getting a glitched Windows XP window look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos187.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3840&#34;
	height=&#34;2304&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another UE5 screenshot showing the spiral now from further away. Left and right of the image has dark silhouettes of pillars and bricks. The spiral shards spawning is improved. Different shapes are in now and they are all varied in rotation even though they are arguably way too big in scale.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after some tweaks, I managed to make my Niagara do the following: pick and spawn 1 mesh randomly between a selection of 3. Scale it up or down randomly. Rotate it randomly. The result meant that some pieces of shards clip into others. As long as my scale was tweaked to be shards smaller than in the image seen above, there were no big clipping offenders. As in there were plenty happening, but could the viewer notice? Not really, unless they paid really, really close attention. As such I decided that its not worth it to spend my time into any clever solutions that would prevent from meshes to spawn clipped into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos190.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1152&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Low camera angle looking up at the flower ceiling and the bright, day sky above. The spiral is now much more thin. The shards spawned along it are much more controlled. Their scale is more appropriate and the visual finally starts to look like its not glitched.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above was pretty much what I settled after the first tweaks. Later on, once Hayley started setting up her cinematic work cameras, I did further fixes here and there on the spawning, scale, etc. I did that so it fits better what she had needs of for the cinematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flowers&#34;&gt;Flowers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important piece that I created, which came right after the making of the spiral, was the flower I mentioned at the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos191.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1418&#34;
	height=&#34;1045&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Substance Painter screenshot. Shows the mesh of the flower. On top is Base Color texture view, showing the flower colored in a cyan, bright blue color. UI to the right shows the Painter layer stack.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;135&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;325px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that my project was an experimentation and learning in UE5 and respectively Nanite and Lumen, it meant I could afford to create the flower entirely using geometry. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend time sculpting a flat petal in Zbrush and then baking it into an atlas to go onto foliage cards. Instead I just modelled my flower and its petals as thick, 3D pieces, straight inside Blender using a subdivision modifier workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos192.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1562&#34;
	height=&#34;1014&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up from UE5 showing one of the new, large flowers, surrounded by snowdrop smaller flowers. The new flower is way too bright and looks almost emissive (although it isn&amp;rsquo;t).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;154&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;369px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t leave my Catmull-Clark subdivision modifier to be needlessly high, I kept it relatively low, but it was still very nice to have something created so quickly and not to have to worry about polycount as you would outside of Nanite &lt;em&gt;(in UE4 for example)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial texturing was a bit too bright in albedo and although it looked alien in a cool way, it was drawing too much attention. As such I tweaked it to be a bit darker like seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos193.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1562&#34;
	height=&#34;1014&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same camera shot as before but this time around the flower is retextured. The idea is the same - blue flower, but now its darker and not nearly as brokenly bright as before. It also has some normal detail on it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;154&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;369px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried to give it a stronger normal map noise to give it leaf-like surface details. I think later in the project I also slightly tweaked the purple and pink grunge to not be as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos194.png&#34;

In the initial versions the flowers had a bright spotlight-esque look. That made them very much in contrast compared to the environment and I think that was breaking the scene. In the second version, without such obvious lights, the shapes work much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this entry we saw the scene move forward thanks to some VFX and some flowers. Those introduced more blue hues that I then tied up with more blue runes and symbols on some of the pillars and walls. Overall that shifted the monotonous gray and low saturation green look away. It made the scene look a bit more alive and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Hayley Rumbold&lt;/a&gt; who I mentioned a few times in the post is my collaborator in the art in this project. She created the cinematic works for the short set in the environment. We will explore that in later posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blooper&#34;&gt;Blooper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the end of this post I will leave you with a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;blooper&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(not really, just an experiment I thought would be fun to try)&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s something I thought might be interesting but at the end abandoned as an idea as it was just way too busy and was overpowering the rest of my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I annotated it with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I made a biblically accurate crystal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it could whisper unsettling words, what would it murmur?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RXM90HEMEU&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;YouTube embed above. Shows a clip from the scene where the crystal in the middle has multiple copies of it, rotated differently. They suddenly all start to shift and rotate in different directions, making it have an eerie symmetry and fascinating movement.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of the crystal in the video above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-010/amarantos198.png&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the main camera angle. Shows the crystal prop duplicated and rotated multiple times, creating an &amp;ldquo;explosion&amp;rdquo; of crystals. Or a &amp;ldquo;biblically accurate crystal&amp;rdquo; as I described it before. It&amp;rsquo;s pieces are floating in the middle of the room, right above the central circular platform.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial series, we will create a vortex VFX basin in Unreal 5. We will go to the creation of geometry, textures and shaders needed for it. Finally we will take a look at blueprints and how to use them to improve the efficiency of our game assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is in 5 parts. This blog page will index those pages and list them for an easier look at all of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;Part Three - Making polar coordinates shader in UE5. Circular distortion shader.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Four - Creating refraction shader in UE5. Adding it as a layer of detail on the vortex.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Five - Improving the efficiency of our work through blueprints and construction scripts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Software:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The tutorial covers Unreal Engine 5, Blender, Substance Designer. You could follow along using Maya and Unreal Engine 4 for replacements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 05 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part One</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:24:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/amarantos070-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 05 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part One" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog entry will be a bit different from the previous ones in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of an overview and writing about my creative process, this one is a step-by-step guide. It is a written tutorial about how to create an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. It also will go over how to create geometry needed by the VFX idea and how to create some quick textured noises in Substance Designer. The textures are one of the driving forces in the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you prefer Maya or 3Ds Max over Blender, then you could replicate the steps I take in your modelling package of choice and create the mesh we will need.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We will use Unreal Engine 5. However, we will not use any new or locked to UE5 features. If you are working in Unreal Engine 4, you could easily follow and replicate anything you see here.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, lets dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into the steps of creating the VFX, lets take a look at a quick preview. It will show us what we are about to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The material shader we will create will allow us to reuse every piece we&amp;rsquo;ve made and derive different colors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will cover how to create only the vortex itself. It will not look at how to make the sculpture, stone basin that the VFX sits in. It will also not look at the making of any other art elements seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious how the environment room was created and then how the crystals shaped to existence, you can do so by reading my previous entries in the blog series. You can do so over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

The camera is from very, very far away and unrealistically small Field of View (or otherwise large Focal Length), reducing the perspective and showcasing the props as if from an orthographic view.&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pieces-necessary&#34;&gt;Pieces Necessary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The necessary pieces we will need and see how to create in this tutorial are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Static mesh - this is a torus shaped into a basin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo; material shader - this is the black and blue material that pans inwards, creating a &amp;ldquo;vortex&amp;rdquo; effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1x Refraction material shader - material using a tiled normal map that refracts light and sits on top of the main vortex as a secondary slice of detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3x Texture noises. One for masking things (linear, black and white). Another for the black and blue liquid visual (this acts bit like an albedo). Then a final normal map that has crystal-like distortions and when tiled the correct amount gives the refraction shader its appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets begin with first creating the Static Meshes needed for the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;base-shape&#34;&gt;Base Shape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive into any detailed steps about how to create the geometry, lets first see the final result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxMesh.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3840&#34;
	height=&#34;2160&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A vortex basin static mesh, seen from a few different angles. First 2 images are top-down view. Then are two views from profile. One shaded, one wireframe. There are metrics on top too, which are transcribed in the paragraph below this image.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following guide we will recreate the geo seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vortex basin above has two key metrics: its wide 2 meters and its tall around 0.75 meters. As it goes downwards in space, its diameter of 2 meters shrinks to 1.5 meter then to 1.2 m then to a final 0.15 meters. The numbers above in the image have floating points but you can stick to the round numbers mentioned just now. The mesh is UV mapped without any seams (planar top-view mapping). Any slight distortion in the islands due to that will not be a problem and will instead help our VFX final result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(You can inspect the UVs in step 5.13, seen right by the end of this page.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are an intermediate to advanced 3D modeller, don&amp;#39;t feel obliged to follow the next steps. By looking at the wireframe mesh above, you could recreate a similar results of your own, however you wish. For the VFX basin to look like the final results you don&amp;#39;t need to constrain yourself to a carbon copy geometry. You could put your own touch of tweaks and personalizations on your geometry and still get an awesome result. If that is the case, skip through all of the Blender steps below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, if you wish to skip the geometry guide, and have created something of your own, head to this link &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for the next part in this VFX tutorial series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-one&#34;&gt;Step One&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by opening a new Blender scene and pressing SHIFT + A to create a new primitive shape. From the drop-down menu, pick a Cylinder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut001.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1531&#34;
	height=&#34;964&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows blank scene. On top &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; menu is open with the &amp;ldquo;Mesh - Cylinder&amp;rdquo; option selected. Text in image reads: &amp;ldquo;1. Press SHIFT &amp;#43; A to open &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. 2. Navigate under &amp;ldquo;Mesh&amp;rdquo; and click &amp;ldquo;Cylinder&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;381px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding a cylinder, in the lower, left corner of the screen we will get options to pick the features of the cylinder primitive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-two&#34;&gt;Step Two&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1531&#34;
	height=&#34;1022&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows the scene with an added cylinder. Text in image reads: &amp;ldquo;3. If you don&amp;rsquo;t see these options, then your menu is collapsed. Click on the text &amp;ldquo;Add Cylinder&amp;rdquo; for it to expand. 4. As options use the ones seen here: vertices 32, radius 1 meter, depth 1 meter.&amp;rdquo;&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a large context menu for &amp;ldquo;Add Cylinder&amp;rdquo; like above doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately show for you, then make sure to look for a small bar menu going by the same name, hidden in that same lower left corner. Clicking on it will expand you the settings seen in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the settings we can ignore. The important ones are &amp;ldquo;Vertices: 32&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Radius: 1 m&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Depth 1 m&amp;rdquo; is not particularly important because in the next step we will actually remove any edge loops that make up the outer ring faces of the cylinder. As such its depth will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-three&#34;&gt;Step Three&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, press anywhere on the cylinder with the left mouse button. Then hit TAB on your keyboard to go into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; (or perhaps you have yours set to ALT+E as a shortcut.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;1025&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows the cylinder clicked on to be selected. Then CTRL &amp;#43; TAB is pressed on the keyboard, bringing up a radial menu with options like &amp;ldquo;Object Mode, Edit Mode, Certex Paint, Sculpt Mode&amp;rdquo; and more. The picture shows the mouse selecting &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text on the picture reads: &amp;ldquo;5. Press Ctrl &amp;#43; TAB on keyboard to switch selection modes. Pick Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;356px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to switch from &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo; and go into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. If neither TAB or ALT+E work for you, then try with the contextual radial menu seen and described in the picture above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-four&#34;&gt;Step Four&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are in &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;, select all faces, everywhere, while keeping only the very top circle face deselected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut004.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Here all of the rim edge faces of the cylinder, that compose its walls are selected. The circle at the bottom, not visible in the picture, is also selected. Through pressing &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to open &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu, all faces selected are deleting, leaving only the top circle face. Text transcription in the paragraph below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;156&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;375px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the image above describes, press &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to select all faces. Then hold down Shift on keyboard and left mouse button click on the circle at the top to deselect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next press &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. It will open the &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. From that dropdown menu select &amp;ldquo;Faces&amp;rdquo; to delete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to select the faces whilst only leaving the top circle deselected. Do whichever way you like and don&amp;#39;t feel obliged to follow the description above as to how to accomplish it. If you wish, select each face one by one with the mouse whilst holding shift. Or instead select by big face loops, by holding ALT and clicking on the outer edge of a face, the edge facing the direction you want to mass select a loop.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-five&#34;&gt;Step Five&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have deleted all of the outer wall faces and the bottom face, we are left only with the top circle face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select it. Then press &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Inset Faces&amp;rdquo;. Click anywhere on the screen to have the lower left corner contextual menu for &amp;ldquo;Inset&amp;rdquo; appear (seen and described in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut005.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot. Shows the top circle face, everything else has been deleted after tha last step. &amp;ldquo;Inset Faces&amp;rdquo; command has been used to give the circle a ring loop of faces with 0.15 meters thickness. The image has a text that is transcribed in the paragraph above.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &amp;ldquo;Inset Faces&amp;rdquo; menu, select a Thickness of 0.15 m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, select the circle in the middle and press &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Delete Face&amp;rdquo; and be left with an outer ring like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut006.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-six&#34;&gt;Step Six&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the inside loop of edges (marked in orange below). Move them down in Z direction to get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut007.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;361px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. That will start a &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo; command. If you follow up immediately by pressing &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; you will lock the movement onto that axis. Move the mouse slightly down. Then press anywhere on the screen in order to get the &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo; contextual menu show up. In that put in -0.07 m as a setting for Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that same edge loop selected, press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale down. Move the mouse to do any amount, then let go (press left mouse button). Once the Resize (scale) context menu shows up, put in X,Y and Z an uniform number: 0.896.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rotate your camera slightly down so you see the mesh from the side.
Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Extrude&amp;rdquo;. Immediately press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to Scale down the newly made extrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to extrude again: Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo;. Follow up immediately by pressing &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo;. Then press &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock the movement onto that axis. Drag the mouse downwards on the screen. In the menu that pops up, put -0.18 m in the Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I keep repeating the hotkeys for common actions like Move, Extrude, Scale and how they work with keyboard and mouse clicks and movements. I do that so this tutorial is friendly to any Blender users, especially those who might be beginners. However if you are an advanced user, feel free to skim through most of the texts here and extract only the important info of by how much and in what axis to extrude, move, scale, rotate.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-eight&#34;&gt;Step Eight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate your camera slightly below the mesh so you can see better. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;ve selected the orange edge loop seen below. Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; then drag the mouse and click. When the context menu shows up, put 0.448 points in each axis uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut018.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The mesh is now seen slightly from below. New loop of faces is created by extruding then scaling down by 0.448 on x,y and z. Yellow text is transcribed in paragraph above.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;356px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets move that selecting upwards in space. The face loop we just created in the last step, we now want to move up by A LOT. Press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move mouse up. After clicking anywhere, menu shows up. Put 0.471 m in the field for Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut019.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;148&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;355px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets rotate our camera on the upside again. In the picture below we don&amp;rsquo;t do any new actions. Instead we look at how your mesh should look so far, when looked from the above angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut020.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1525&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;442px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I mention this in a step later on, but: if your mesh so far looks roughly similar, but is not identical, and has some differences, don&amp;#39;t worry about it. This VFX relies on creating a --vortex basin-- but the rules for making that are not set in stone. You can have slight differences, or some of your loops might be slightly misplaced up or down, compared to mine in the pics above. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that your VFX won&amp;#39;t turn out just fine. It will look good.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move cursor down. We are now moving the newly extruded loop down. In the Z put -0.6 m. Seen below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut021.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The mesh seen from above. The loop is moved down. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; and move cursor down. Move the new loop down, until it looks like above. You can get it to that by putting minus 0.6 m in the Z in the context menu.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets rotate the camera to look from below once again. Then press &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale. Scale down uniformly on all axis by 0.356 points. This will give you the result like in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut022.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The mesh is seen from below now. The previously extruded and moved down loop is now scaled down by lots. That gives it an inverted cone appearance. The yellow text is transcribed in the sentence above.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;358px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; to extrude, then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; immediately to scale down. On every axis, scale down by 0.702 points. That gets us the little ring seen in the image below, that is sitting slightly flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut023.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-nine&#34;&gt;Step Nine&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets move the loop from last step down in space. Press &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Move&amp;rdquo;. Then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock on that axis. In the Move settings in context menu, put in minus 0.095 m for Z.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, rotate your camera to look at the mesh from above (so you can see it in a similar way to the image below). In this image we don&amp;rsquo;t do any actions. We just want to start looking at the mesh from this angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut025.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the edge loop marked in orange in the image below. Then lets twist it. Press &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Rotate&amp;rdquo; the selection, then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock on that axis. Click with the mouse anywhere. In the menu that shows up, put 12 degrees. (if you put say minus 12, it will also work. Any angle works really, as long as its not a crazy big angle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut026.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;355px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Move your camera so you see the mesh a bit more from the side. Select the orange loop seen below. Lets twist that one too. When it&amp;rsquo;s selected, press &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Rotate&amp;rdquo; then &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock onto that rot axis. For an angle put 26.3 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut027.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the mesh slightly from above again. Select the orange loop seen below. Twist it. Put a rotation angle of 17.7 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut028.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the top loop, seen in orange in the image below. Twist this one too. For an angle put minus 46 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut029.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the mesh from below / slight profile view again. Select the loop in orange below. This this one too. Reminder: to twist use &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; to rotate, &amp;ldquo;Z&amp;rdquo; to lock onto that axis. Then press on the screen. In the context menu put an angle of 24.9 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut030.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate to look at the mesh from above. In this picture we don&amp;rsquo;t do any actions. Your mesh should look similar to above. If there are slight, very small differences, don&amp;rsquo;t worry. The VFX will still look awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut031.jpg&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Go out of &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; and back to &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo; (reminder - for me, I do that by pressing TAB on the keyboard. You might have a different keybinding though.) Select your mesh - either by clicking on it or using the Collection Manager. Look at the right hand menus. Click on the &amp;ldquo;Modifiers&amp;rdquo; tab (its icon is in blue color and looks like a wrench). To the right of it then click &amp;ldquo;Add Modifier&amp;rdquo;. From the menu that shows up in picture after the next one, select &amp;ldquo;Subdivision Surface&amp;rdquo; as a modifier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your modifier settings should use the following: Catmull-Clark as algorithm type. Level Viewport: 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your geometry is subdivided and smooth now, but your normals are faceted. Lets smooth them out. Right click with mouse button anywhere on top of the mesh. From the &amp;ldquo;Object Context Menu&amp;rdquo; that shows up click to select &amp;ldquo;Shade Smooth&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we&amp;rsquo;ve applied the modifier, lets go back to &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. The mesh should look like below (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t then most likely you&amp;rsquo;ve not applied the modifier yet. As such revisit the previous step.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut040.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1525&#34;
	height=&#34;1023&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mesh is seen with a now dense wireframe. This wireframe is visible in &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; because we&amp;rsquo;ve applied the modifier and are looking at the final geometry as result from it. Yellow text is transcribed above, as usual.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start selecting every second loop (hold ALT on the keyboard and then left mouse click on one edge and it will select the entire length of it). You can start selecting every second loop from wherever you like on the mesh. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to start from the spot I have started from in the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut041.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1526&#34;
	height=&#34;1019&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The mesh seen slightly from above. Every second loop of edges, spanning from the center to the outer part of the mesh, is selected en loop.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-eleven&#34;&gt;Step Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have selected every second loop, your selection should look like in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut042.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1530&#34;
	height=&#34;1010&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mesh seen from above. Every second loop of edges is selected, shading the mesh in orange selection color.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;151&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;363px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. This brings the &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; contextual menu. From that menu select &amp;ldquo;Dissolve Edges&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut043.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1529&#34;
	height=&#34;1018&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;With the selection of edges made, this image shows pressing &amp;ldquo;X&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard which brings a dropdown menu. In that menu there are &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo; commands like &amp;ldquo;Vertices, Edges, Faces&amp;rdquo; etc. Select &amp;ldquo;Dissolve Edges&amp;rdquo; which is in the middle of the menu.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;360px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of deleting the edges should give you a mesh that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut044.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1525&#34;
	height=&#34;1019&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;3D mesh seen from identical angle to before. The wireframe is much less dense. This is due to us deleting every second loop.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotate the camera slightly. Then select the very top edge in the inner basin (it&amp;rsquo;s marked in orange in the image below). That edge looks too sharp, so we will bevel it (this will hold our UVs better).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut045.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1517&#34;
	height=&#34;1018&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The mesh seen bit from the side once more. The image showcases the very inner and top loop of edges selected in orange.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While holding the selection from the previous step, press &amp;ldquo;CTRL+E&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard to start a Bevel. Drag the mouse slightly and click away for the context menu to show up. In the menu, use the settings seen below: &amp;ldquo;Segments: 1&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Width: 0.0169m&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut046.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1526&#34;
	height=&#34;1024&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same angle and selection as the previous image. The edge is now beveled which results in a wider array of faces.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look from above and zoom into the mesh. Select the very inner, final loop, where the mesh ends. Seen in orange below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut047.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1529&#34;
	height=&#34;1019&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mesh is now seen more from the top and zoomed in, looking at the centre were faces are missing and there is no cap.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;360px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;E&amp;rdquo; to extrude then &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; to scale inwards. Scale down on all axis by any amount. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to close the loop yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut048.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1524&#34;
	height=&#34;1022&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same angle as before, now showing a new extrusion of faces being scaled in. We are in the process of closing a cap.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. This will bring up the &amp;ldquo;merge&amp;rdquo; menu. From it select the top pick called &amp;ldquo;At Center&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut049.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1064&#34;
	height=&#34;1022&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Mesh seen from the previous angle. On top is a drop-down, contextual menu about &amp;ldquo;Merge&amp;rdquo; commands. We get that by hitting &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;104&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;249px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result should look like the closed cap seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut050.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1530&#34;
	height=&#34;1022&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Angle like before but now in the very inner part all vertices previously selected are merged resulting in a nice end cap.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;359px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the above, our geometry is done. Now lets double check our normal directions of our faces. Then lets UV map. Those are the two final steps before we call all of this done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-twelve---faces-direction&#34;&gt;Step Twelve - Faces Direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go out of &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo; and back into &amp;ldquo;Object Mode&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut051.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1857&#34;
	height=&#34;1019&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;We observe the mesh from further away now, having moved the camera bit back. There is no wireframe on top because we&amp;rsquo;ve went out of Edit Mode.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;182&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;437px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, we want to double check if our normals are pointing in the right direction. In Blender, unlike Maya and 3Ds Max, when the faces point in the wrong direction, we still see shaded result. In the other two modelling softwares instead we would be seeing invisible mesh, and when rotating the camera we would understand thats the issue. Here instead we want to enable &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; viewport setting so we can observe any issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the arrow (number 1 marked in the image below.) Then tick ON the &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; box in the menu that pops up. This is marked as (number 2) in the image below. Your mesh should then turn into a blue color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut052.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1914&#34;
	height=&#34;1125&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender UI seen where we press on the little blue arrow, marked with NUMBER 1 in yellow on the image. Dropdown menu is then show and we press NUMBER 2 arrow, which points to &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo;. The mesh gets shaded in blue color (or perhaps red, if you have an issue, but we cover that in the next image).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;408px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your mesh is red, that means your normals are facing the other way (inverted normals). This means that when seen from this upper side, the mesh will be invisible once in Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut053.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1522&#34;
	height=&#34;1018&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The mesh seen from the previous angle but now instead of tinted in an overpowering blue, its tinted in red color. As mentioned above, this indicates our normals are inverted.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;358px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix our faces direction (normal directions), first press CTRL+A to open the &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; submenu (make sure the mesh is first selected). From that menu select &amp;ldquo;All Transform&amp;rdquo;. In cases where the mesh had some crazy transformations not applied yet, the above step fixes the normals and makes it all blue. In this case chances are it wont fix it for you, but its a good thing to remember and always do anyway (to Apply - All Transformations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut054.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1534&#34;
	height=&#34;1016&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image showing the red tinted mesh selected. Then &amp;ldquo;CTRL&amp;#43;A&amp;rdquo; pressed on the keyboard, bringing a menu on top of the screen, where the mouse is. That submenu is called &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; and has a list of commands like Apply&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;Location, Rotation, Scale&amp;rdquo; etc. One of those is &amp;ldquo;All Transformation&amp;rdquo; and we select that.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;362px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With All Transformation applied, if your mesh is still red, go back into &amp;ldquo;Edit Mode&amp;rdquo;. Press &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; to select all faces. Then press &amp;ldquo;CTRL + N&amp;rdquo; to open the &amp;ldquo;Normals&amp;rdquo; context menu. From it pick the top option - &amp;ldquo;Flip&amp;rdquo;. The mesh will then turn blue. You can go back to Object Mode and disable the &amp;ldquo;Face Orientation&amp;rdquo; coloration from the viewport menu seen few steps before.&lt;/p&gt;

Image shows a &amp;ldquo;Normals&amp;rdquo; submenu brought up as described above. Top command in it is &amp;ldquo;Flip&amp;rdquo; and thats what we press.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;We are done! Your UVs should look like below and they are exactly what we need. We are all wrapped up with the geometry section of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/vfxtut058.jpg&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This completes the geometry we need. You can export you Static Mesh as you usually do, and import it in Unreal. If you are using Unreal 5, then tick &amp;ldquo;Import as Nanite&amp;rdquo; off, as we need this as ordinary static geometry. We will explain why that is in the next parts of the tutorial. That is where we will cover how to created the textures necessary and then how to assemble the Unreal material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part of the tutorial: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;The Amarantos Ritual - 06 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. It covers creating the textures necessary for the VFX. We will be working in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/</link>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos044-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword---new-website-feature&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foreword - New Website Feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before diving into the art analysis and the showcase of the project progress, I wanted to take a moment to mention a new implementation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the help of my brother Miroslav, I&amp;rsquo;ve integrated a &amp;ldquo;before and after&amp;rdquo; image comparison into the website. As such from now on, in any blog entries where it&amp;rsquo;s fitting and useful, you might find an interactive element like the one below here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This type of image box has a slider in the middle. You can move that slider to reveal two images positioned over one another. Handy for wireframe and tech views of meshes and environments!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give it a go:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;imageDiv0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#39;img background-img0&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#39;img foreground-img0&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;input type=&#34;range&#34; min=&#34;1&#34; max=&#34;100&#34; value=&#34;50&#34; class=&#34;slider&#34; name=&#39;slider&#39; id=&#34;slider0&#34; oninput=&#34;moveDivisor(&amp;#34;0&amp;#34;)&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#39;slider-arrows0&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;main-angle&#34;&gt;Main Angle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My attention in the scene, at this stage of the development, had been at crawling around roots and vines. I wanted to populate the walls so they have more visual interest through some props that break up their monotonous, bare look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve missed reading about my approach to making those roots and the Blueprints and splines I used in the process, you can go back to the previous entry of this series and read it &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos045.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the usual main angle in the environment. Showcases a floating, black orb with metal surface. It shines brightly in a day light cast from a door that is ajar and from the cracks on the walls. The orb is above a circular, ruined platform with a basin with black goo in the middle. Roots crawl on the walls. Unreal Engine 5.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at the above stage, I remember thinking that the walls indeed look a bit more interesting now. The roots in front and the way they curl here and there, was giving a nice dimension and in some spots casting great shadows and ambient occlusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing was that the roots even warm in color and bright in the spots where the bark had been exposed, still looked relatively gray and merging with the walls color and texturing. As such I continued to have a big worry about color. I thought that the runes I&amp;rsquo;ve scattered around, the stone tablets and trim sheets with green color are all nice. I kept it overall saturated green, even though the space looks forsaken and old. Yet it felt like that green is not enough. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be in juxtaposition to the grays of the old stone surfaces. In turn that was making the environment look rather flat and dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;color-tests&#34;&gt;Color Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I decided to have an experiment of seeing what colors could be more exciting and look more invigorating than the current motives shaded in green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos046.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The previous, main camera screenshot showcased again. Here there are four versions put next to one another. First one shows the room with green inscriptions and decals. Second has those elements painted red but also has little, glowing flowers. Third is all of that but shaded blue. Fourth is all of it tinted in purple instead. Screenshots from UE5.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I was mainly experimenting with the colors. However, I also quickly blocked out a pod shaped flower prop. I wanted to give that a bit of a glow. That was yet another way to splash some more color, given that the pods were going to be frequent and placed on top of the roots. In the last image &lt;em&gt;(purple version, lower right corner)&lt;/em&gt; you can also see some actual flower foliage too. I thought that the lower ground levels were still mostly empty, even with the new roots and pottery. As such I decided to splash around some foliage and grass. The foliage, I thought, could on purpose have colorful petals that match whatever the main color in the scene was going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flower-foliage&#34;&gt;Flower Foliage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos047.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1643&#34;
	height=&#34;848&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two images put next to one another. Left is a Blender view of the flower pod prop. Out of it curl upwards green flower stems that on top have blue petals. Image on the right shows those same flower props but tested with materials and Subsurface Scattering in UE5. In that image some of the flowers are lit in an aggressive and silly looking test.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;193&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;465px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating these flowers really was an experiment that went quick and straightforward thanks to Nanite. Being in UE5 and using Nanite meant I could try out whatever petals and stems I liked. I could keep them geometry and not have to be concerned with baking them down to flat atlas textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to use these props for an optimized game project, instead of just a pretty environment art scene, I would most definitely want to take the foliage one step forward and create some aggressive level of detail (LODs). It would also be good to bake the meshes into LOD cards. Nanite dynamically manages triangle counts very well, and one would think LODs are not necessary, but LODs are just way too good to be entirely removed. In the latest seasons of Fortnite, for example, where the game runs on UE5 with Nanite and Lumen, if one pays close attention, one can still see switches going from a Nanite mesh to an LOD super lowpoly static mesh or to a flat card billboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concept-paintover&#34;&gt;Concept Paintover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had put in flowers and more color. Yet I could not make up my mind on my own as to if I wanted red, blue or purple as the main motive. As such I kept sending different angled screenshots of those color versions to my friend &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://oliverharbour.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Oliver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollie didn&amp;rsquo;t reply immediately but instead later that day he came back to me with a surprise paint over. He had taken one of my screenshots, seen the color variations I offer, heard the pitch where I was thinking out loud about how I want to replace the Houdini orb in the middle for a crystal. With those things in mind he made a really gorgeous concept paint over, featuring the colors he thought would be best plus a floating crystal visualization in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos048.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Upper camera angle showing the Unreal Engine 5 scene. The metal orb floats in the middle while the color through decals and inscriptions its surrounded by is blue.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This angle above is the one Ollie took. And this is what he created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos049.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same camera angle but this time around the image is painted over on top. The metal orb is turned into aggressive, pointed crystal. It features a plethora of blues and purples.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a stunning paintover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was incredibly surprised and inspired when he showed it to me. I could not stop staring at it. In the following weeks, in the moments I felt down or like I don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy to keep working on the scene, his concept art was what energized me and kept me going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollie visualized quite a few ideas I had in my mind but never got to trying out at that stage too. Later on I kept that paintover as a guide to what I want to do and try next, after I were finished with changing the Houdini orb to a crystal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few examples are the mist, clouds and fog surrounding the room. I thought they were very moody and nice and later in the project I filled the gaps of the platforms with VFX clouds using FluidNinja &lt;em&gt;(something we will look at in detail in later blog entries)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the beams of light, like lasers, striking through the room and casting light as if offset in chroma to be both blue and purple, I thought was absolutely mind blowing. I tried that later on too. I did get a version of it working using spotlights and point lights. It was making the performance in the scene muddy though, as light overlaps was way too large, causing pixels on some surfaces to be lit too many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I had to instead try and &amp;ldquo;bake&amp;rdquo; the moving light effect through gradients created directly in the PBR shaders used for the floor and wall pieces. Something that I thought was a cool idea but didn&amp;rsquo;t get the chance to fully implement. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit this idea from Ollie some other time, as an exercise in Tech Art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;from-an-orb-to-a-crystal&#34;&gt;From an Orb to a Crystal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Ollies concept guiding me I set off to replace the orb in the middle. For the time being I committed to a purple color too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos050.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The camera angle seen the last few pictures. This time around the room is splashed in purples. The metal, Houdini orb (that had anims through VAT) is now replaced for a crystal blockout in gray colors.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel amazing to remove the orb. I had invested a lot of energy and time, learning how to make it in Houdini. In the shots seen in the past blog posts it might be static and boring. But it actually had a fluid sim animation on top. I had learned how to do Vertex Animation Textures (VAT) through it and of course the orb was very close to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter that though, I knew that the scene needed something different. An abstract, moving orb like that is cool, but perhaps in another environment and another context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to remind yourself of what VATs are and how the fluid animation looks, the one I refer to above, you can do so over at - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

Next two are images taken in Zbrush, showing sculpt pass on those same shapes. The rock orb now has dug crevices and details that it didn&amp;rsquo;t have in the Blender version.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I blocked out the initial orb and crystal pieces in Blender. From there I took it into Zbrush where I cleaned up my topology to hold better brush strokes. I subdivided to get myself to a high polycount but didn&amp;rsquo;t go overly high. I knew I wanted Nanite meshes at the end and as such I mainly was after creating detailed and interesting silhouettes.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another camera angle looking at the scene. The orb floating in the middle is now a rock. From it protrude bunch of square and cube crystals. They are colored in a flat purple. The room around has purple decals too, and the roots have small flower pods with white and purple lights on them. From the door to the right, day light floods in.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Ollie had went for staggering blues and purples in the concept paint over. With purple being his favourite color too, I went for that as a main motive for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, though, I once again struggled with color. I set off to texture the surface of the crystal and whatever textures and patterns I would try, with purple as dominant color, it kept giving me results way too noisy and busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that my mistake was to not rely on the already detailed geometry through Nanite and use simple albedo and normals on top. As in no overly complex and colorful albedo with edge details derived from curvature or thickness bakes. Also no normal map overcomplicating by having any of the edges pop in or out, to give them more dimension, again by deriving detail from smart masks using curvature or thickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead the albedo would be very flat. The normal map - nonexistent in the unique UV textures. The geometry was detailed so it didn&amp;rsquo;t need any normal maps a part from detail tiling surface normals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such in the shader of the crystal I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique UV texture: the Albedo channel. Some Roughness too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiling texture UV channels added on top of that: two Normal maps. One with large tiling gaussian imperfections and dots. One with smaller tiled plasma-like noise, sharpened to look more like a crystal matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s when I went a way from the purple and more towards blue. But Ollies love for purple extended as a love for purple in me and later in the projects I found other opportunities to bring back some of those hues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to blockout my shapes in Blender as I feel quicker over there. Then once I like the overall appearance, I take the blocks inside Zbrush where I Dynamesh and subdivide to then sculpt on top. As seen above &lt;em&gt;(make sure you moved the white bar in the middle, so you could see the comparison between the two pictures)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before heading into Substance Painter to bake any channels or start any serious texturing, I tested the purple colors and how the shapes react to light once they are more glossy &lt;em&gt;(seen above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;uv-maps&#34;&gt;UV Maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I liked what Im seeing as a preview above, I exported a slightly decimated geometry version of the sculpt. I set off to UV map it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos057.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1406&#34;
	height=&#34;739&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blender screenshot showing the UV mapping of the crystal and rock prop. In this one the crystals are hidden and the image showcases only the rock orb and its UV set.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;190&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;456px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I UV map in Blender by adding seams by hand and then running an unwrap command. As long as you put in good seams, the unwrap comes out pretty good and doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need you to polish it by relaxing the shells or tweaking them by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos056.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1588&#34;
	height=&#34;1057&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Blender screenshot. In here one can observe both the orb rock and the crystals. However, the UV shells to the left showcase only the shells for the crystals. The entire mesh was put into 2 UV sets: one for orb rock and one for crystals.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;150&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;360px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mesh, as mentioned few times by now, was meant to be Nanite, as such I kept it a bit denser on poly. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to run it through automatic UV mapping because it would have split it into many triangles and needlessly cut UV shells. If that happened, not only would its appearance not be so good after texturing, but it would also increase file sizes exponentially, given we are dealing with high geometry counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;texture-baking&#34;&gt;Texture Baking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the UV mapping done I went into Substance Painter in order to bake some texture channels. I had a dense Nanite mesh, so I anticipated that I will probably not put a lot of importance on things like unique Normal Maps, instead I would tile normal map noises in the engine itself. Which is exactly what happened with the crystal parts of the prop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos058.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;147&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;354px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to splash interesting colors and figure out what the patterns and tiling normal maps I might use would be, be it inside Painter or UE5. As such in Substance Designer I made these two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos059.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Substance Designer rendering showing two materials overlaid above one another. Top one is a teal colored and metal-like crystal noise. One below is a painterly and acrylic looking splash of blues, purples and pinks.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;88&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;213px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-unreal&#34;&gt;Back to Unreal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the above things drafted, I started experimenting with using the Substance Designer graphs. I did that inside of Painter for the most part, and struggled once I previewed it inside Unreal 5. I say struggled mainly because I was not convinced by the visual and disliked most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this first test above, you can clearly see how using my exciting, very detailed Substance Designer material graphs, gave everything an incredibly heavy, noisy and terrible visual look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flat purple had a simplicity that was beautiful and now lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see the issues I described in the sentence above, but I could not exactly figure out how to solve them. As such I tried to simplify - less colors, less noise, and what if I tried blue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was still wrong - the look was still noisy. The albedo rich in mud, the edge color derived from the curvature and thickness bakes was way too overpowering too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

  &lt;div class=&#39;slider-arrows5&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Image to the left is the before seen blue with lots of noise in albedo on top. The new image, to the right, is a more ocean-like blue with giant splashes of white color, instead of smaller noises.&lt;/figcaption&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to realize slowly its all too noisy so I started to simplify the albedo. What if it were blue but with larger tiled splashes of color, instead of small noise? Seen above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(By the way, that albedo splash of color seen above is still one of my initial Substance Designer graphs. Here though its only used as albedo. The other channels are off. In Designer I had exposed lots of parameters such as color, noise type, noise size and overall tiling, among many other. As such here I reused my work by just changing parameters so the splashes are giant and not tiny, thus noisy.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was too simple, and too bright. As such, a step back again, seen above. I tried purple again, tried edge detail, but more controlled. It was still way too noisy again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I removed the edge detail, went back to flat purples and blues. But this time the crystal looked like from an ice cream advert&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;(colors seen in right image above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed the purples and made the overall tones darker, less in the splashes of an ice cream advert visual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was still in love with the idea of purple that Ollie had given me. So even though I left it for the time being, later on I returned to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage the crystal was a bit dark but I was making progress. It being darker and slightly more flat but shiny also helped me realize something else. It was the fact that if I wanted to capture the edges and give them detail, I should do it through Fresnel functions inside the Unreal material shader I was creating for this crystal. The fresnel for edges would work few times better and be more interesting than any albedo + normal + roughness edge detail created in Substance Painter. It would sit more elegant, more gem-like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Left is the darker tone, blue crystal. To the right is an improvement on it where the colors are the same. However, there is a splash of white fresnel, giving it more edge detail. In the inside of the crystal there are also splashes of purple.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If above, on the image to the right, you inspect the crystal dead middle of the picture, you can see few white lines. Those are the most staggering examples of the fresnel from the above camera angle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also added little rays of bounced light (well not really, its not real light, its all fake!) in the edges and crevices of the Nanite geometry. Something that again looks few times better than anything baked directly in the albedo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went back in Substance Painter and textured the rock orb. If the blue crystal above uses a unique albedo + lots of fresnels + lots of tiling normal noises, then the rock instead uses only unique textures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rock is pretty much a standard PBR shader with nothing fancy going on. The blue gems on it that I masked and texture in Painter to match the color and patters of the crystal, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even give fresnel. Because they are overly shiny it sat fitting and okay, even without a fresnel, when compared to the rest of the crystal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final result, seen big &lt;em&gt;(picture that you can click to zoom, unlike the before-and-after sliders above)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recap&#34;&gt;Recap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap some of the decisions, focusing on the crystal, blue part and putting them more as advise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t put in albedo / roughness / normal details on the edges, through unique texture sets - instead use a Fresnel &lt;em&gt;(this is our Fresnel Number One)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider adding another Fresnel &lt;em&gt;(this is our Fresnel Number Two)&lt;/em&gt;. This one you can invert, so instead of shining as a cage around the edges of the geometry, it shines off the surfaces right in the middle of it, that look at us and at the camera angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of having busy unique normal details, consider tiling one surface detail with large dents and imperfections, as if looking at scratched surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tile another one right after - another normal detail - this time for smaller, micro imperfections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scene-from-afar&#34;&gt;The scene from afar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/amarantos068.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;The main, lower camera angle, from inside Unreal 5. Looks at the crystal hovering in the middle of the picture. To the left of it is a metal looking placeholder mannequin that showcases the scale of the room and the crystal orb.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at these shots, the lighter tone blues that you can observe in the lower part of the orb and its gem, are direct result from a fresnel of that color. This showcases how useful the fresnels are in making the whole illusion of looking at something that is a crystal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oliver Harbour, who did the initial scene paint over with the crystal seen in this blog, is an illustrator and a concept artist. You can find his work over at his &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://oliverharbour.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. He is also on &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://twitter.com/oliverharbour&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

    &gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/oliverharbour&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olivers help was inspirational and invaluable to me. Later on he also concepted some original crown designs for the character seen in the cinematic short of this project. We will take a look at a detailed breakdown of that headpiece crown and the concept art in a later blog entry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog entry we looked at picking colors. We went for red, then to blue, switched to purple, and then back to blue. But along the way, while testing those colors, we learned a lot about what works and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t. As such it was a fruitful experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then went through a detailed breakdown of the texturing process of the crystal, as seen through lots of before-and-after image sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned a few times, I went for an overall blue tone, but the help and inspiration from the concepts and the purple colors that Ollie did, were incredibly important for me. I mentioned this too, but later on in the project I revisited and relit the room a few times. That was in order to create a secondary &amp;ldquo;realm&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; of the scene, to be used in a cinematic short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that, I settled onto purple colors that are incredibly exciting and intriguing, and in later entries we will look at those in detail as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos025-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 03 - Roots and Nanite Sculpts" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;walls-of-the-circular-room&#34;&gt;Walls of the Circular Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog entry we looked in detail at the center platform and its sculpt. I showed how the mesh underwent a few changes, getting it from alien crop circles appearance to a more ordinary brick and pavement look. You could revisit those screenshots over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, slightly skip over looking at the lower walls of the environment and what I did with their sculpts. I also mentioned that we should look at the upper parts of the scene too, and briefly talk about the wall pieces, windows, and dome elements there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos025.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Lower ground camera screenshot that is pointed towards the upwards parts of the scene. It reveals the orb floating in the middle of the scene, bathed in light (in the shape of alpha card God Rays). Above the orb one can see the circumference of the initial lower room shrink inwards. On the walls of that are windows cut in the form of circles. On the very top, the ceiling is dome shaped. It opens up like a flower flooding further with daylight the otherwise dark interior. Unreal Engine 5 screenshot.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roof-blockout&#34;&gt;Roof Blockout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a step back, in this screenshot seen below we can see my initial blockout of the ceiling. My approach to putting the place together was as follows: I blocked out the lower levels walls. I put in the middle platform so the orb is centered, floating on it. I added little bridges and a bunch of pillars. I then added one upper level of walls - the ones where the circumference of the room shrinks once for the first time. It creates a dome like appearance where the pillars are. The walls above get to host some circle cut windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had all of this blocked out, I set on to sculpt further all of the above described assets. After sculpting them I did an initial texturing pass. Even then, when I still had no roof, I knew I want to create a dome appearance on the upper ceilings. I knew I want to open up a tall space around there and not end up the celling ending close to the orb, thus making a claustrophobic space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I knew and was planning all of that I had still not made most of the blockout upper assets and ceiling pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead once I had done the first sculpting and texturing pass of the lower levels, and once I had seen it work well and I liked it, I set off to continue the missing ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos026.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Image crop looking at the upper parts of the scene. Shows the dome ceiling building up few levels of shapes and silhouettes. The top one is the most intricate one, with flower and fractal elements. All of the upper parts have placeholder, gray, materials while the lower parts are textured. UE5 image.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;116&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;279px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how the upper levels looked - in mid-blockout - when I was testing out the shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only were I testing out the visual and silhouette of the shapes themselves but I also was engaged fully into looking at something else too: their use with light. I wanted to create interesting patterns at the very top that then would flood the lower parts of the environment in light that leaves spellbinding, exciting shadow silhouettes. Here light itself was my main attention and my main &amp;ldquo;asset&amp;rdquo;. It dictated what was going to happen with the sculpture pieces. Light inspired me in the making of the flower-like opening on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;564px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having figured what pieces work and what pieces I like from the initial Blender blockouts, I set off to take some of them inside Zbrush. The modular building pieces that I liked I retopologized in Zbrush using Dynamesh. I then further sculpted and polished details on top. Some I duplicated multiple times and shattered in different ways, deriving me extra dressings and details.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Lower, orthographic camera view of upper dome ceiling assets. Top parts has a fractal-like appearance. Lower dome bent has a crack and damage in one version, while the other (to the right) is intact. The images were taken inside Zbrush.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;347px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step inside Zbrush I used Decimation Master in order to lower the polycount of each sculpt. I had most pieces sitting at 2-3 million tris. Nanite could handle that but it would result with each mesh being around 200-300 MBs, maybe even more. I found that would be needless given that this high density of poly was not exactly looking more detailed than a well decimated version that would be 100-200k tris (instead of 2-3m). The file sizes of those would be much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to remember that we need to UV map these too. UV Mapping a 3m triangles sculpt would be much more taxing on Blender (and on us) than a 300k tris one, which would be a trivial task to uv map if one has a polished, good geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;door-asset&#34;&gt;Door Asset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above described process I used for the creation of the front door as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a quick shape exploration in Blender before moving anything into Zbrush. I played with an array modifier with rotations in order to try and get some interesting shape. Here I once again thought at light as my main asset, as such I wanted to create some silhouette that once lit would aggressively cast some interesting shadows in the middle of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The walls to the left and the right were shapes just for placeholder as I knew I would use the existing modular walls in the project instead of making brand new ones unique to the corridor of this door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos031.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was slight difference in the process of making this door, when compared to the walls we looked at before. In here, I UV mapped my initial pieces and then in Zbrush used non-destructive approach both to the sculpting and the decimation of the topology by the end. That way I preserved my UV maps and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to re-map once the sculpts were ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the same approach I used for the circular platform in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is a detailed look at my sculpt pass on the door. I&amp;rsquo;ve not included the spiral shape as I thought its not necessary to run a sculpting pass on it - instead it could be ordinary Nanite mesh with just a tiling material on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the sculpt was done I decimated the asset while preserving UVs. I went into Substance Painter where I baked my maps and set off to texture. In the image above the UVs differ slightly compared to the Blender shots before. That&amp;rsquo;s mainly because I did some extra polish before taking it outside of Blender and into Zbrush. With that I utilized my UV space better to not have the empty space seen in the first Blender UV screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;god-rays-alpha-cards&#34;&gt;God Rays Alpha Cards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the ceiling and the dome appearance was created I put in some god rays and atmospheric 2D alpha cards. Those face the camera at most of the times and if you wanted similar ones you could dig out materials and blueprints set ups from Epic over here - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/blueprints&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Blueprints - Legacy UE4 Sample Project&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is UE4 and its marked as Legacy in some spots, but the Blueprint set up (and materials) found in there for &amp;ldquo;God Rays&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Fog Cards&amp;rdquo; are set up incredibly well. Their design and function stands perfect even when migrated in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;roots&#34;&gt;Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the alpha card rays implemented and my attention came back entirely on the lower parts of the scene. Where all of the &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; would take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at it and could see that it was sitting predominantly empty. No detail props or set dressings. Even the walls met the floors at a perfect 90 degrees angle which took away from the natural look of the space and made for an artificial CG look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to remedy that. As such I looked into making bundles of props I could scatter around and about. Pottery, ground dirt pile, smashed pieces of pots. Stone tablets with inscriptions or symbols on them. Fallen parts of the upper ceiling pillars, now sitting on the dusty floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet my walls remained empty. Overly simple. The upper parts of the environment had cracks and tons of damages on the walls, spilling in even further light and using that as a detailing asset. But the lower ones? They were mostly intact. Empty. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to dig out any holes there because the camera would be seeing straight out of them. That would break immersion, because, as you could guess, the exterior scene is completely empty. As such that idea was a no go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is when I started thinking about roots. What if oversized, magical, incredibly wide roots were spiraling around like snakes? They could populate the walls better and reach towards the middle of the room, towards the floating orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched that idea out loud to my friend Sophie Deschamps. She loved the idea so much, and being the cool artist she is, without me even asking, took the screenshot I had just sent her and painted over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She got me this artwork:&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The environment captured from one of the usual camera angles seen before. On top is a concept paint over by hand. It consists of immense, magnificent roots crawling out of the window gaps and reaching towards the orb in the middle. Once a root reaches the middle, its width becomes smaller and it changes color into bright greens and blues. In the middle part the roots start to wiggle upwards, as if trying to reach and touch the orb in the middle of the scene. The orb is colored in an overpowering blue aura.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;173&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;417px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this concept paint over, I knew immediately. I knew that indeed this is the next move and as such I set of to making some roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not describe how helpful and inspiring this paint over was, as such, thank you, Sophie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blueprints-for-the-roots&#34;&gt;Blueprints for the Roots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My process behind making the roots was at first in big chunk in UE5 itself. The space is already blocked out and I wanted to have a direct and immediate way to &amp;ldquo;crawl&amp;rdquo; around different roots and see their influence and shape on the environment. As such I used a spline system Blueprint directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have opened Blender and positioned my floor and walls in the configuration I have in the scene. That would be a trivial and not very time consuming task as I already have all of my measurements set. Its just a matter of moving them from one place to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I dislike jumping in and out of Unreal. I like doing as much as I could in the engine itself as that then keeps my art process with less friction. Frictionless means more creativity and energy spend towards whatever I am creating and not the dialogue that I have between the different software packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Video above is UE4 but things seen in it should work well in UE5 too. If some parts are hard to follow, I suggest giving a go to this one instead - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKIiWa19EMI&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial - Splines - Spline Meshes&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. I remember using that at one point or another as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to move between modelling packages, as mentioned already, I imported in UE5 a Blueprint system I had made years prior. It&amp;rsquo;s one that I had started for some random UE4 project I could not even remember now &lt;em&gt;(tutorials for making similar blueprint are seen in the videos above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I had carried it into my Orbital Gateway, (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-013/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;) where I had used it to scatter in line all of the metal platforms. It was also used to shape all of the big, vacuum like cables that are the kernel of the vision of that project. In that Gateway environment I had implemented some improvements into my initial spline Blueprint too. Things like being able to per instance basis pick different static mesh and different material to go onto the spline. It was a solution battle tested and as such I wanted to reuse it here.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot of the very first moment I dragged around the tube splines blueprint. I started with very thin and subtle ones. In the middle is the orb floating in the room. To the left of it is a tube that looks like cable. It starts from the upper part of the picture and crawls down the walls and reaches the middle, where the orb is.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in Blender and I made an initial tube that I kept higher in poly than I usually do (as in with extra edge loops). Using Unreal 5 now, unlike back in my previous projects that were Unreal 4, here I could afford higher polycount with the knowledge that all of my blocked out pieces will end up being Nanite meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tube I put into the spline Blueprint. Over the course of a few days I slowly build up bundles of large roots. Those were blockout so if any when taking a turn in the world were looked lowpoly, or any surface got distorted, it didn&amp;rsquo;t matter. I wanted to block them out directly in UE5 but I still had in mind exporting the resulted meshes back into Blender in order to polish the visual slightly and UV map them by the end.&lt;/p&gt;

Now both to the left, where there were thin cables, but also in the middle of the picture and close to the camera, are tubes that are much more thick and actually look like roots.

		alt=&#34;Lower ground level camera. Below the floating orb in the middle, bathed in alpha cards light, there are the roots blockouts. Those slither around on the ground and once reaching the middle of the platform start to move upwards, as if trying to touch the orb.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to mention that I&amp;rsquo;ve not implemented control over the thickness of my splines on per spline point basis. As such I could not select a middle point of a root and scale it up to give it thickness. Instead I exported my uniformly thick roots from Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First step to do that was to Merge Actors by selecting the spline - opening &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; from the Tools submenu - hitting &amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(you can see that in the image below)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would ask me a location to save the spline as a static mesh under the Project Directory. I then navigate to it in the Content Browser, right click on its icon and go to - Asset Actions - Export. That allows me to save the resulting mesh outside of UE5 as an *.fbx. I open that in Blender and I do my thickness scale up polish, UV polish, and subdivision to make it even smoother Nanite mesh. I import that back into UE5 and I replace the original spline blueprints.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 editor screenshot, showing an action in 3 steps. First open Tools submenu and select Merge Actors. Second select your spline blueprint in the world (see in the middle of the image). Third, use the newly opened Merge Actors window to save out the splines into ordinary Static Mesh. I suggest doing this by the end of your projects even on splines you like the visual of, as keeping it to splines increases draw calls immensely and will drag performance down. Saving out to Static Mesh bakes it down to one draw call.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;In the paint over from Sophie the roots were incredibly large and impressive. I slowly build up mine to be large too. But I knew I will probably keep them smaller than her concept. I took that decision with the idea of keeping the focal point to be the orb. I thought that if I introduced roots that were very, very thick, they would draw viewers attention. Also I though that if indeed they were that big, I would need to figure out some set dressings and props to put on their surface, as to not leave them too bare, empty, boring and lacking detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;filling-up-the-empty-parts&#34;&gt;Filling up the Empty Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With those roots looked at, we could take one step back and see the build up of set dressings in one corner of the environment. That way you could get a better perception of how all of the described details and props added up to build up the picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Image above shows a dirty looking Zbrush sculpt I made. It looks not that amazing in the Zbrush render, but once placed in the world with a tiling ground dirt material, to match the floors already there, it helped hide the 90 degrees I mentioned some time ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then polished and revamped the pillars (image above). I wanted to give them better shape and texture. Something more realistic and intricate than the first draft. I also added pottery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-003/amarantos042.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we can see the influence of the roots. I textured them using tiling materials from Megascans that I mixed in my own way using triplanar mapping in my UE5 shader. There is also a slight jump with me introducing some foliage and flower pods, but we will go into describing that process in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we saw the scene fill up with props, dressings and more detail. We looked at using Blueprints spline systems for blocking out roots directly in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, however more going on during, and immediately after everything seen above. It was experiment and struggle with color that persisted for a little while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted different color combinations where the roots flower blooms would light up the scene in blues, purples, reds, oranges. The orb would carry on that color in its fresnel too. Experimenting and switching between those colors went on for a while and then I got some ideas and help from another friend, just the way Sophie helped and inspired me with the roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up we will look at that and how that influenced changing the orb in the middle for something else.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos008-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 02 - Reference" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;novel-and-old-concepts&#34;&gt;Novel and Old Concepts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second entry of this series I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to explore my references and early inspirations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at lots of artists, games, and photographs from all kinds of places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start a new art idea its good to look at plenty of references. You can source your idea or inspiration by mixing together existing paintings, photos, short stories, books and more. It&amp;rsquo;s also integral to look at real life photos. We aim for believable and realistic spaces and layouts (or at least I do in this project). That is even when our subjects are fantastical. As such parts of what we are about to create needs to be grounded on reality. Those parts need to have roots in what is already familiar in the viewers eyes. Then on top you sprinkle bit of the eerie, unknown, novel and bizarre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;current-stage&#34;&gt;Current Stage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the previous blog (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 01 - Beginning&lt;/a&gt;) after figuring out my Houdini orb and that it will be the center piece of the composition and the layout, I was at this stage of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos007.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3162&#34;
	height=&#34;1779&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot from the previous blog entry. A circular room with placeholder gray materials and strong orange glow. There is a fuzzy, liquid metal orb in the very middle. Around are pillars with ornate details on their tops. The walls have slight gaps for sci-fi-esque windows. There is a door that is slightly ajar and sunlight comes out of it.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some further tweaks and added a little bridge platforms to connect the middle, circular platform to the outer edges of the room. In the very dead center, I cut a gap in order to place more &amp;ldquo;liquid metal&amp;rdquo; type of effect. I wanted to lead to the idea that perhaps in that basin in the middle of the room, there was an inactive substance. Few people, aliens, or some other creatures, enter the room and interact with that inactive substance. With their presence, it comes to life. It forms into the orb that then starts to float in the upper, middle point, space of the large room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you perhaps remember from the last entry, I really wanted to lead towards the idea of a ritual happening in this space. The creatures that enter the room bring the orb to life. They perhaps worship it, fear it, but are also astonished by it. Does it bring them energy? Food? Pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the relationship between these characters and this &amp;ldquo;inanimate&amp;rdquo; object that the next moment seems to come to life and be lively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I start new scenes, or any other type of art, I usually make up a few sentences that form a story. The moment I have that I start to ask questions. Those questions are very much like the ones above. They help me refine and see more than what there is at first in my mind. They help me make a 3D space that is more believable, interesting and rich in story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is an exercise I think you should try yourself. Whenever you create a layout, ask yourself why its the way it is? When you place props, ask yourself why they are there and what their relation to other objects around them is? Ask how you can tie up one item to another so they look more coherent?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as the image above. This time the strong orange glow in the left parts of the circular room is removed. The gray, placeholder materials have a cooler tone in general as well. The liquid metal orb from Houdini still floats in the middle of the room, but the central platform is now connected by little bridges. There is a basin cut in the middle too, with darkness inside it.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into more screenshots inside this 3D space, lets take a step back. As mentioned in the start of this entry, I want to include my references and early influences behind the art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.pureref.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;PureRef&lt;/a&gt; to put all of my reference images in one place. I like using this piece of software because it&amp;rsquo;s very lightweight. Some people use &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://miro.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Miro&lt;/a&gt; which has a similar idea but more annotation tools, sticky notes and other cool features. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that PureRef is easier on the RAM than having a webpage open or using the Miro desktop software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my ref board I make sure to mix plenty of 2D art, 3D art but also real life photographs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos009.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;973&#34;
	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot overlooking my entire PureRef board. Lots of game screenshots, IRL photographs, concepts 2D artworks, 3D art and more is seen as tiny thumbnails.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;130&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;313px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to ref boards, this one above I would rate as a relatively tiny. In most of my previous projects I&amp;rsquo;ve went through many more bundles of subjects and pictures and usually my boards expand much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in the creation of this scene I&amp;rsquo;ve been more controlled on the scope of the pieces I want to capture and create. As such that is also reflected in my ref board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing to mention is that in the board above in some spots there are screenshots from the project itself. I like to screen cap where I am and put it right next to the reference in order to compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-goals&#34;&gt;Initial Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets zoom in on some parts of the board above and see things further in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you about the artists that inspired me and credit them properly in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t personally know any of them but their work is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into this current ritual project I had spent a long while in another block out I was creating in Unreal Engine 5. It was the test scene where I transitioned from UE4 to UE5 and learned the intricacies of UE5s Nanite and Lumen. That project itself was in an &amp;ldquo;Early Preview&amp;rdquo; build of UE5 and had lots of issues and crashes. I never uploaded any screenshots from it, but at some point I might revisit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I got my hands on Early UE5, official demos such as &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/a-first-look-at-unreal-engine-5&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Lumen in the Land of Nanite&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, then later &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/unreal-engine-5-early-access-available-now&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/introducing-the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;City Sample (The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal ENgine 5 Experience)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; released. After reading official docs about Nanite and seeing the sculpts and works in those demos I put a goal for my project. That was to try and create sculpts that are as dense and details as some of the assets seen in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I came across the artworks in the image above. The left image, for example, is a sculpt by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/kDyQ0A&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Musaab Shukri&lt;/a&gt; done exactly for the UE5 demo &amp;ldquo;Valley of the Ancient&amp;rdquo;. Work for Epic Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Images to the right are concepts by &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/VgbLzN&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Zak Foreman&lt;/a&gt;. Those are again for the same demos. It depicts the visual fidelity and detail richness that Nanite could pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having realized these will be my visual fidelity goals, I set forward to find some real life photographs again. Some real spaces to get inspired from even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-diwan-i-khas-india&#34;&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (India)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort), or Hall of Private Audiences is a location in India that I found lots of inspiration in. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see the resemblance in the intricate carvings here when compared to the previous UE5 demos artworks we saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos011.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Reference board screenshot consisting of photographs from Hall of Private Audience, Fatehpur Sikri, Uttar Pradesh, India. Images depict red stoneworks carvings that loop into intricate patterns and snake like elements. There is also a photo from - &amp;ldquo;Interior of Hodha Bai&amp;rsquo;s Palace, Fatehpur Sikri&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;158&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;380px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very early blockouts I had, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really plan to head towards red stone look like the above. I still thought that the carvings are amazing reference for the sculpts I had yet to create. Also for any texture work that would go on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;circular-rooms&#34;&gt;Circular Rooms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also pinned on my board some old, random photos of different circular rooms. I wanted a radial room after all, so I knew I should look at some from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;

The others feature baroque and other architectural styles of circular rooms. Most have an opening in the ceiling that hosts set of windows that leak light in. Another photo is of a cave with god rays coming from open ceiling.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at different spaces that have above light leaking in and creating nice god rays. When showing my very early blockouts to some friends, they all mentioned &amp;ldquo;Shadow of the Colossus&amp;rdquo; as a game that has very impressive interior shots with lighting just like that one. I&amp;rsquo;ve not played the game myself yet, but I knew I had to put those nice screenshots from it on my moodboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;star-wars-jedi-fallen-order&#34;&gt;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m creating a project I always have immediate influence from the games I am playing at the time. In this case I was playing through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order when creating parts of this environment. These screenshots from the game came into the board relatively late. Yet they (and the game) had a big influence on some of the decision making I took. It also helped me solve some visual issues I had and introduce more details like crack decals on the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I particularly looked at this section of the images, seen below:&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;383px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the decal work and base texturing here and found lots of inspiration. Later on I needed more props to populated my empty spaces with, and after being inspired by Jedi I created ground dirt scatter piece as well as a set of pots - some intact, some smashed into pieces. I will showcase these later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collaborators&#34;&gt;Collaborators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later through the project I had the pleasure to be inspired and helped by few more artists. Those are some of my friends and their influence here was direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;initial-assets&#34;&gt;Initial Assets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having seen most of the reference images, we could step back now and see some of the first blockout shapes I made in Blender.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the pieces I initially made and blocked out the scene. Some artists use Zbrush to block out pieces like that. I prefer to make these using a subdivision workflow, directly in Blender. I start by extruding a cube around and then beveling it in such a way that when I apply a Catmull-Clark subdivision on top, I get smooth, but not overly smooth shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make an absolute mess of the geometry. In some cases I insert lots of ngons (not seen in many obvious places here, but I still do). When using Catmull-Clark I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about my geometry flow mainly because I know the algorithm will make all of it into quads by the end when applied. If those quads follow awful edge loops, I frankly don&amp;rsquo;t mind. I don&amp;rsquo;t because I know that what I am making is then directly going into Zbrush. Once in there I will Dynamesh to get my to a density of geometry I like. When I do that any bad edge loops and flows gets retopologized to something much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos019.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a resulting topology (image above). One that actually is pretty clean compared to some of the descriptions I wrote above, that happen most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the walls I later duplicated a few times in Blender:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To then as described above take into Zbrush:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos018.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;132&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;318px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I refined my geometry, made topology that can hold good brush stokes and then detailed on top to get me to more finalized assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this all is an exercise in Nanite, I was not scared to be dense in topology and detail. I tried to make silhouettes rich in detail where the cracks and damages are. In some of the other wall pieces, I stamped stencil details in the form of writings, symbols and ritualistic stone carvings. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to rely on baking those down onto a lower poly, but instead use Decimation Master in Zbrush to get me to a lower dense poly, suitable for Nanite (as in being 150-200k tris. Even though Nanite could totally handle keeping some of the sculpts at 2-3m tris, it proved to be pointless and not add much detail).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;platform-sculpts&#34;&gt;Platform Sculpts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos020.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Three props seen in a Blender screenshot. First one is a large, circular platform. Second is a pie cut modular piece. Third one is a bent wall.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;179&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;431px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My platform in the very center of the middle, I kept as one big shape. That is the first prop seen in the Blender screenshots above. Keeping it one big shape might sound a bit insane because it might be incredibly hard to keep high texel density even on 4k textures. That&amp;rsquo;s given how large the entire piece is. As such I briefly considered making a pie cut 1/4 of it, to then rotate by copying 3 more times and getting me the entire circle. I decided against that mainly for one reason: I knew I will create a dense Nanite mesh. As such I knew that most of my detail will sit in the geometry itself. If on top a slightly lower density albedo texture went, I decided it would not be a problem. Sculpting details on a platform this large on top, would also be quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the outer ring platform that wraps around that same platform, I decided to use the &amp;ldquo;pie cut&amp;rdquo; approach. I did that mainly because with its radius going further out the main platform, its cover area increased. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t scared of the texel density (though at that point I should have been) but more of the chore that sculpting such a giant piece would turn into, if I were to keep the entire ring a unique prop, instead of a pie cut. As such I made it into a &amp;ldquo;modular&amp;rdquo; cut and duplicated it many times in the scene, rotating it about, building up the rooms floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image was the first sculpt I did on the platform right after I took it into Zbrush. Going back to that talk about &amp;ldquo;familiar vs novel&amp;rdquo; right at the start of this blog, with this sculpt I later started to worry that the swirling, circular motives looked too alien. They are nice in an &amp;ldquo;alien crop circles&amp;rdquo; kind of way. But are they perhaps too abstract for this scene? Making everything look too smooth, too fudged and &lt;em&gt;non-concrete&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos022.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Substance Painter screenshot. Shows the same platform as above, but now the sculpt is different and has more &amp;ldquo;brick&amp;rdquo; appearance. To the right is the UV view. All of the brick details are actual geometry as this is a Nanite mesh and I wanted to keep it more dense.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;178&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;429px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I went back and sculpted it once more. This time around keeping a certain array of circles towards the middle, but in the outer parts giving a more structured, brick appearance. Seen in the image above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scene-shots&#34;&gt;Scene Shots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the platform in the context of the scene:&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the old version. Below is the new one. I also put in some scene lights recolors and texture recolors to give everything a more controlled and realistic appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos024.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 5 screenshot. Camera angle is the same as above but now the platform sculpt is more refined. The little bridges are textured. The lighting in the scene is less orange and red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoomed in towards the middle, we can inspect the platform and the &amp;ldquo;darkness basin&amp;rdquo; in the middle too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-002/amarantos025.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gaps of the bricks I put in flat planes. On those I added a liquid metal texture. At some point I was imagining the idea of cutting little canals going from the middle basin towards the outsides of the platform. In those canals liquid full of white stars would flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought its an interesting idea but I later abandoned it as I was worried that after introducing some other details on the outskirts of the scene, having black and white, high contrast, liquid in the cracks of the platforms proved to introduce visual clutter. It was making the scene fall a part more than it was tying it together or the novelty of the idea was worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post we will look at the upper parts of the scene. We will inspect all of the wall and dome pieces seen in the Blender screenshots above which I used to create the higher parts of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also revamped the pillars, just the way I reworked the middle platform above. I gave them more structure, carved runes and interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed seeing all of this,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last nine months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly developing my latest environment scene. It&amp;rsquo;s process documented both in writing and in work-in-progress images has been scattered across my social channels. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of positive comments and encouragement a long the way by some wonderful people. Some of you, dear readers, might have even seen the project and the aforementioned images already. I wanted to still pull it all together, so to speak, into one condensed place. Tie up the scattered posts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that tie up, I hope for some of you to find inspiration. Others I hope find insight and resources towards what and how I set to accomplish the things I have in my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos001.jpg&#34;

It grows in an overpowering reds, oranges and yellows. It&amp;rsquo;s emission is picked up in real time through Lumen and casts light on the floating primitives next to it.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the first screenshot I took inside the environment scene. An orange, abstract, floating, orb. This had been an experiment of importing an animated orb directly from Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-beginning&#34;&gt;Project Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2022 I was experimenting with a small game prototype I had started in Unreal Engine 4. It was a topdown camera RPG with lots of spells and action. I never got to the part of prototyping much of this &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; but I did blueprint a lot of the initial movement, camera work, and then also had started on a few spells and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t exactly be going into details about the prototype itself as that would call for another long post of its own, and would branch us away from the topic of this current scene. The context important to the start of this environment is that in early July 2022, after creating the initial Blueprints foundation for a few abilities inside the game, I set off to learn and experiment with Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos002.jpg&#34;

In the middle of a screen is the player character. Up and right from her is a well prop with a mysterious red glow.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;397px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought process behind getting into Houdini was that I wanted to create some spells VFX and animations. But the idea I had in mind was for fluidity and smooth movement, one that would be accomplished through fluid simulations. Yet for obvious performance and scaling reasons I could not get into creating actual real time fluid simulations (not that I have the knowledge to do that even if there is a way to scale it performance wise [I bet there is, smart people out there certainly have accomplished it]).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These orbs above are my initial Houdini experiments, as seen imported inside my UE4 game prototype. They have a looping animation attached to them. You can see preview of it further down in this post in some of the YouTube embeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vertex-animation-textures&#34;&gt;Vertex Animation Textures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years prior I had heard a lot about the technique of baking down animations in vertex look-up tables. Those end up in the form of a bitmap that then is read from a shader in order to tell each triangle of the mesh how and where to move to. Interpolate between those different key &amp;ldquo;positions&amp;rdquo; on the texture and you get an animation (this is an incredibly oversimplified explanation, apologies to anyone that might be reading it and happen to be the type of Tech Artist to implement these amazing things from the absolute scratch!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of technique is called Vertex Animation Textures &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vertex-animation-textures-for-unreal/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;(VAT)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animations in the form of VAT have one incredible advantage over other type of game animations: it&amp;rsquo;s entirely driven in a shader. Onto the GPU. We don&amp;rsquo;t use or deploy any types of bones or skeletons and as such any object you animate in this way can end up as a Static Mesh. The animation, as I mentioned, then happens on the GPU through the reading of the vertex look-up table texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is memory footprint, of course. It comes in the form of the quite oversized in width and height look-up textures (which makes them have large file sizes). Also for a smooth and interesting &amp;ldquo;fluid&amp;rdquo; like animation, your Static Mesh might end up being quite rich on polycount too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vat-demonstration&#34;&gt;VAT Demonstration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first picture you can see a fuzzy ball mesh I created parametrically in Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos004.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;1130&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Houdini screenshot. UI of the software is seen and in the left viewport one can inspect the fuzzy orb mesh.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;169&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;407px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then imported that mesh inside Unreal 4. I didn&amp;rsquo;t export it from Houdini as an ordinary static geometry. Instead I exported it as a VAT and in Unreal used a SideFX plugin and shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1420&#34;
	height=&#34;980&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 4 screenshot. Viewport look of the fuzzy orb mesh. It looks whole, top side reads &amp;ldquo;24,898 triangles&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;144&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;347px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that orb, seen appearing like a proper mesh, is after the SideFX shader for reading VATs has been applied. If we ignore that shader and take a look at the geometry that the VAT exports, without material graph or the vertex look-up table textures that are generated, this is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos006.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1420&#34;
	height=&#34;977&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 4 screenshot. The same orb mesh seen above looked at again. Now the shader is not used and as such we see it as a giant, 3D matrix collection of triangles scattered in space.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned already, image above is orb imported in Unreal but no VAT textures are applied yet. As such its a collection of what to us appears like arbitrary placed triangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;useful-vats&#34;&gt;Useful VATs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use VATs in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to animate, say hundreds or thousands of actors onto the scene, all visible, even if they are incredibly low-poly, and use no complex textures to drag down our texture streaming budget, we often will still hit performance issues and hardly have any low MS (high FPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for that is because when we display on the screen actors like that, ones with skeleton rig animations, they each end up being a separate draw call. Those draw calls go through the CPU and as such we end up being bound on CPU before we even get to use much of the potential that our GPU has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such the VAT is a trade-off where we might increase slightly the polycount, increase the use of textures budged, but end up with incredibly optimized amount of draw calls. The orbs you see above, I could render 100-200 of them in the scene, visible from one camera angle at all time, and still have low MS and good performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;animation&#34;&gt;Animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, there is also the more obvious part. It&amp;rsquo;s the content of the animations. In Houdini I wanted to make some fluids like sims that I could perhaps pull of through a shader in Unreal entirely. It would require of me to offset my orb surfaces with World Position Offset to give it a fuzzy, liquid like movement on its surface. But then if I wanted the visual to look proper and as cool as the ones in the VATs it would mean I need to recalculate my normals as well so light bounces off those WPO surface movements correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I will give a go at recalculating normals and making a shader like that at some point in Unreal. But for now I wanted to use the opportunity to learn fluid sims in Houdini and then learn VATs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing an orb with fluid like movement animation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation, seen after VAT import in Unreal. In this video below, the VAT shader is from SideFX but I have added control over Albedo, and Emission and I&amp;rsquo;ve plugged in a Fresnel function. It gives it the glowing effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the VAT orbs but in UE5. These are now shaded and have more refined visuals.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I found all of the above incredibly interesting and fascinating, even before I dived to learn the nitty-gritty of it all. I am not really a VFX artist or an animator. But I do have a love for Tech Art (even if I&amp;rsquo;m not a Tech Art in my fulltime studio job either!). My setting off into making these type of fluid like animations for my spells came in big chunk through the motivation of me wanting to see if I have in me what it takes to learn and deploy these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out I did. To no one surprise because as we usually do when it comes to most tooling and software in the games industry, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and concepted, created then implemented the techniques. A chorus of ingenious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m saying this because after all of the descriptions above that might sound incredibly complicated to those of you who have not yet experimented or learnt this type of stuff, you might be left with the misconception that this is incredibly hard to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s indeed not as complicated as it sounds. The biggest challenge I faced in learning Houdini was how to actually come up with my initial orb animation. When I did that, the moment I wanted to turn the anim timeline into a VAT and import it into Unreal, I had a bunch of tools already created for us by SideFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to implement or write any shader. I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to automate any export - import. Those were all already available in Houdini (better yet, they come out of the box with exporters for UE4, UE5 and Unity alike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this and hoping of trying these type of techniques, either follow the page I linked above (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vertex-animation-textures-for-unreal/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SideFX - VAT for Unreal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or follow these videos, which I followed - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cPRYwF-Tvg&amp;amp;list=PLoltx0CAXYf75OzQ3H_eGboHlrrf44gsi&amp;amp;index=1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VAT 4 | RBD | Unreal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaKNjIC66_8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VAT 5 | Fluids | Unreal&lt;/a&gt; - though I believe those two are just mirrors of the VAT link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into them I suggest watching some general videos of how to manipulate and animate geometry to look like its surface is changing, or even doing some fluid simulation tutorials. After all before you try to turn something into a VAT you want to make sure you have a Houdini animation ready in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create my orbs I experimented and at the end came up with a pipeline that creates geometrical primitives &amp;ndash; feeds them into Clouds &amp;ndash; feeds into VDB &amp;ndash; then VDB to Polygons. That with recalculated, smoothed normals produces results similar to the Houdini video I embedded under the &lt;strong&gt;6. Animation&lt;/strong&gt; section of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out how to merge different orbs into an abstract structure, I recommend giving this video a go: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hkcRgCgzo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hkcRgCgzo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually the one I started with. Later on, once I realized I want to try VATs, I winged it and added the &amp;ldquo;convert to clouds then convert to VDB then back to polygons&amp;rdquo; part I described above. I did that because I found that was the easiest way for me to add motion to the otherwise static orbs produced in the tutorial in the sentence above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-scene&#34;&gt;Environment Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had made some floating orbs and they were animating nicely inside my UE4 game prototype, of course my Environment Artist side kicked in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think how even though I love using this inside the game prototype, it would be very fun to try and use it inside a polished, set dressed scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered just creating a large, circular room inside my game itself. Then set dressing it and polishing it to a vertical slice. As if when you walk inside it you walk into a finished game environment. It wont matter if the entrance or the parts before that were placeholder and checker board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s around the time I got this story unfolding in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the chamber shifted around them, their worship remained unmoving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular, repetitive room. Just a few modular pieces.
In the middle there is a shape that changes like fluid, using Houdini and VAT.
It has strong emission and perhaps could light the room entirely thanks to that and Lumen? Test it in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape will pulse and be animated thanks to the VAT and combination of Niagara curves and wave functions.
Next to it will be in circle a number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are on their knees like in a ritual worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They move up and down their upper torso, while remaining in position, waving hands in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point the shape &amp;ldquo;glitches&amp;rdquo; into a bunch of triangles (try using a wrong Look Up Table / Textures for the VAT?).
As that happens, one of the people is lifted in the air, rotated 180 degrees and then slowly floated into the shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape consumes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;6 July 2022&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got that story and jotted down those ideas above on paper, I knew I have to open a new scene and focus entire on that. I put my UE4 game prototype on the side shelf. I opened a new UE5 scene and started blocking out the space. The VAT Houdini orb I made would be the center piece. The jewel in the middle that I spent so much time on and learned so much through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-scene-shot&#34;&gt;Early Scene Shot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the above analyzed and described, we can now dive right into the environment side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some hours of blocking out and making some initial building wall pieces in Blender, here is what I took the scene to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post in this series we will take a look at my initial reference board. We will also see the different modular pieces I made in Blender and how I went about moving them into Zbrush and sculpting having in mind my end result will be used as Nanite meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
