&lt;p&gt;There are many reason as to why a game project or a prototype could have low performance. In order to find the source of the trouble, one needs to profile both their CPU and their GPU intensive processes. Different things we do in an engine, mechanics or visuals that we implement can end up on the CPU or on the GPU. We could have a perfect performance on one of those, but if the other one is lacking, we will be negatively bound to it. That is what we mean when we try to analyze whether we are &lt;strong&gt;CPU-bound&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;GPU-bound&lt;/strong&gt; in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many student&amp;rsquo;s projects that are not supposed to be mechanically or visually complex, but simple and elegant on purpose. They are just blockouts of 3D spaces that are a &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Level Design&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; exercise more than anything else. In their project, though, the student will still struggle with performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mostly a sketch, level design blockout, yet the FPS is low. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Old screenshot from an UE4 project from my university days. It depicts a space station on the surface of what seems to be a satellite. All of the meshes are blockout pieces and have gray, placeholder textures. I had set up some of the floor plates as blueprints and as such I had messed up my draw calls.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;culprits&#34;&gt;Culprits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons that could cause the issues. One would need to in detail profile their project in order to find the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to student works though, there are some culprits that I often see repeated again and again. As such we could make an educated guess and say that, as a student, the project you are working in right now, might have exactly one of those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those four main reasons are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking out using BSP Brushes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocking out by making blueprint actors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;creating a loot item that has an animation on the CPU;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using lots of overlapping lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first three are actually the same issue, disguised differently. That is the problem of &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;draw calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. We will look into that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-engines&#34;&gt;Game Engines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Engine:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The examples we show in this blog are mostly in UE5. If we were doing things in UE4 the situation would be nearly identical. Nanite in UE5 handles draw calls better than UE4 but most of the explanations I mention as culprits for low performance cannot be fully alleviated by Nanite. As such the issue persists.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unity:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In my students days, I didn&amp;#39;t know about a lot of these tech issues that I&amp;#39;m about to describe here. I learned about the culprits and how to resolve them back in my first industry job. It was an indie game dev studio. In there, I actually worked in Unity. Even though Unity can be quite different from UE5 in some aspects, lots of the fundamentals are the same. If you are learning and working with Unity right now, you would still benefit from reading this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;issues-explored&#34;&gt;Issues Explored:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;draw-calls&#34;&gt;Draw Calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue that I most often find in students projects is mismanagement of draw calls. This one is so prevalent that I think it can be found often in indie projects out there too. Those are projects that are done by experienced people who might not have found good ways to manage their draw calls yet either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw calls is a topic that is not very often discussed at universities and schools either. As such it creeps as a mistake in so many game prototypes &lt;em&gt;(and some finished, released games too)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Draw call:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A draw call is a request going through the CPU, that will inform the GPU what object to render and how to render it. The request comes with a bundle of information like position, scale, material IDs, material usage and more. It can be for a single object or a batch of objects.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In larger game companies, knowledge and experience flows freely, and as such when it comes to their games there will often be people, or custom tools, that will directly optimize and look at the draw calls footprint through the different stages of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way most engines work is through common and easy tactics that when applied will have your many objects on the screen end up in batches of draw calls. That way the scene gets optimized and the number of draw calls is controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to always keep our draw calls amount low.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are some things you might do that will hardly ever batch. Those things will skyrocket your draw calls amount:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bsp-brushes&#34;&gt;BSP Brushes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One case study for an easy way to skyrocket your draw calls (&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thats very bad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) in both UE5 and UE4 is through the usage of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BSP Brushes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few example screenshots from my environment project &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-014/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;2018&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-call-tip-004.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from UE4 where an environment scene is seen in its early stages. It showcases a Japanese shrine in the style of Izumo-taisha (Izumo Grand Shrine).There are multiple levels of height and lots of wooden structures blocked out in gray and green checkerboard materials.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the image above, my project is in early blockout. I love doing my measurements and shapes exploration for the different buildings through BSP brushes. But there is a giant drawback to using BSP brushes. If I am not careful and aware of it, I could easily create a larger blockout that then has incredibly poor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine the things seen above, but suddenly duplicated many times and blocking out a level that is few kilometers wider, instead of the smaller section of level seen above. The poor performance created by the BSPs will then even be exponentially higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-call-tip-005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;2484&#34;
	height=&#34;1397&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another screenshot from the same UE4 project as in the image before. This time the shot shows it in later dev stage. There are more finalized, wooden textured props. The layout has been improved too. There is grass and trees blockouts in the background. &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo;, 2018.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the image above, we see a later dev stage where I have already replaced all of my BSP brushes for actual static geometry, created in Blender &lt;em&gt;(or Maya, which I used back in those years)&lt;/em&gt;. By replacing the BSPs, I fixed my performance. A lot of blockouts and students projects never get to a stage of replacing BSPs for static geo. That is understandable - the BSPs serve a perfect purpose and the level created is a level design blockout, not something that needs to have finished set dressing. It&amp;rsquo;s not wanted to replace the brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by not replacing the BSPs, we&amp;rsquo;ve left in the scene a type of actor that carries an incredibly high amount of draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Issue&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes cary a lot of information in them that gives them their custom dimensions. For example, a parallelepiped is represented by the length of each of its sides. In the options of the BSP we can change any of those sizes dynamically. We are given lots of freedom for iteration. That freedom comes at the cost of draw calls. Each object has more than one draw call (due to the dimension options in it). Each object is unique too, which makes it impossible to batch any draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Solution&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes can be baked down (also called merge). They can be converted into a finalized, static geometry, that cannot be dynamically changed in dimensions. Through that bake, the draw calls are reduced to low amounts.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;merge-down-bsp-brushes&#34;&gt;Merge Down BSP Brushes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to win back our good performance, when using BSP brushes that we intend to keep in the level, is to bake down the BSPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Step-by-step how-to for merging down BSPs:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the BSP Actor that you want to turn into ordinary static geometry;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the right hand menu, look in the &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; of the Brush component;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick the location to save it;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done. Engine does the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engine will save a new static mesh that is in the shape of your BSP. It will also replace your old &amp;ldquo;Brush Component&amp;rdquo; for a &amp;ldquo;Static Mesh Actor&amp;rdquo; that has more efficient draw calls and is the result of the bake down we just did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The steps, illustrated:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-001.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;A screenshot from UE5. A blank level is seen with lots of checkerboard texture geometry primitives. A selection gizmo hovers over a selected, lowpoly, sphere. Yellow text on top points to the right side &amp;ldquo;Details panel&amp;rdquo; and us clicking on &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; then on &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text is transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the brush geo. Expand &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; tab. Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1503&#34;
	height=&#34;953&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same image as before but now there is a submenu that has popped up on the screen after pressing &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo; the first time around. This menu shows the project directory and asks us in what folder to save the geometry that we are about to create. Yellow text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select where to save. Press &amp;ldquo;Create Static Mesh&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(blue button seen above)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/merge-actor-003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1503&#34;
	height=&#34;953&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical to before image but now the selection on the sphere has changed. On the right hand side, in the &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; panel the sphere is listed as a different component. Yellow text described below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;157&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;378px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that now your component type is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. We turned the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Brush Component&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(has lots of draw calls)&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static Mesh Component&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(has manageable, lower amount of draw calls)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go over your scene and do that for each unique type of geometry shape you&amp;rsquo;ve created. After turning one shape into a static geometry, replace any other BSPs visually similar to it for the newly created static geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;proof&#34;&gt;Proof&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we jumped to the solution above, without me presenting any evidence. Lets say that before you went through all of the ordeal of merging and baking down your geometry, you wanted to see proof that indeed BSP brushes are as bad as I describe them to be. Here is some:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;cmd&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to see some evidence is to analyze the draw calls amounts on a screen at a given time and compare it to the same screen but with some of the &amp;ldquo;static mesh&amp;rdquo; actors swapped instead for &amp;ldquo;BSP brush&amp;rdquo; actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we expect to see, given all of the reasoning I went through so far, is that the &amp;ldquo;static mesh&amp;rdquo; actors filled screen will be low on draw calls. The screen filled with &amp;ldquo;BSP brush&amp;rdquo; actors instead will be incredibly high on draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do exactly that by using the console command seen above, inside Unreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/cmd-001.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;An image of a blank scene in UE5. The left side of the editor UI is seen. An arrow points to the lower part where &amp;ldquo;Content Drawer&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Output Log&amp;rdquo; are. Next to them is a &amp;ldquo;CMD&amp;rdquo;. There is a black bar that says &amp;ldquo;Enter Console Command&amp;rdquo;. Yellow text says to click on it to start typing.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;90&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;217px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the cmd seen above and start typing. Write:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then hit &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. A profiling window in green colors will show up on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/cmd-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1325&#34;
	height=&#34;1150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot of a screen identical to before (blank UE5 scene). This time, we&amp;rsquo;ve typed into the cmd and a profiling screen has popped up on top. Lots of green text describes different stats. By the bottom, in &amp;ldquo;Counters&amp;rdquo; under &amp;ldquo;Present time - 5.40ms&amp;rdquo; there is &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls - average 13.23 and max 53.00&amp;rdquo;. Orange arrow points to that and yellow text says &amp;ldquo;Lots of useful stats here but what we are after right now is this line. Mesh draw calls.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;115&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;276px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve circled the line above which we are after on this newly popped up &amp;ldquo;Scene Rendering&amp;rdquo; profiling screen. We can see that Mesh draw calls are max 53.00 and min 5.00. That is expectedly low amount given that right now our camera frustum (viewing frustum) is looking at a mostly empty corner of the level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at a part of the screen with some static meshes and BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-001.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1010&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A screenshot of a mostly empty, default UE5 scene. There is a checkerboard floor, a blue sky, a yellow bench and 3 geometric solid primitives colored in white.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;365px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above showcases a scene with a few assets of type &amp;ldquo;Static Mesh&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1539&#34;
	height=&#34;1011&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image that is the same, previously empty scene, but now on top of the screen are overlaid stats from scene rendering. Lots of green text with lots of important information. In this case we are looking at &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls - average 19.92 and max 29.99&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;365px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we do &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; on the screen we see that the mesh draw calls of this scene are low. Average of 19.92 and max of 29.00 (&lt;em&gt;seen above&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/draw-proof-003.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image of the same camera angle as before. Now next to the orange bench are added lots more geometry primitives. Those are cubes, cones, polyhedrons. They are all shaded in dark gray checkerboard texture. They are all BSP brush actor types.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;364px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, in image above, we add a bunch of BSP brush actor types to the scene. Those are in the form of various geometry primitives but the important part is that they are BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The same camera angle as before but now most of the geometry is hidden under the green text stats scene. Looking at the &amp;ldquo;Mesh draw calls&amp;rdquo; line of it tells us that average draw calls are 951.62 and maximum are 1,916.00.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we again do &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; on the screen above, we see that now our draw calls have sky-rocketed. On average they are 951.62 and on max they even go as high as 1,916.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large number, as explained already, is due to the BSP brushes.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;An image that looks at the same angle as before but now its a collage of four similar images. Image one, (a), is a close up of the orange bench and the BSP brushes next to it. Image two, (b), showcases the stats of that scene. Image three, (c), looks identical to image (a) but now the BSP brushes have been converted to static meshes. Image four, (d), looks at the stats of image (c) and it shows how they are exponentially lower than before. The numbers are transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final figure, we have top row images &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt;, consisting of the scene full of BSP Brushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bottom row, images &lt;strong&gt;(c)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(d)&lt;/strong&gt;, we have used the technique described in this blog post and have turned the BSP brushes actors into static meshes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visuals between &lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;(c)&lt;/strong&gt; are identical. Yet the scene in &lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; that had BSP brushes has average of 951.62 draw calls. The scene with only static meshes, seen in &lt;strong&gt;(d)&lt;/strong&gt;, has 82.48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Conclusion from comparison above:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BSP Brushes, as seen above introduce lots of needless draw calls. Keep your level blockouts and your environment art scenes free of them by converting to static meshes and your performance will be much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;short-explanation&#34;&gt;Short explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you intend to use some geometry as static? Did you turn it into a blueprint because you wanted to attach something else that is static to it?
If yes, then turning it into a blueprint might have turned it into &amp;ldquo;movable&amp;rdquo; geometry that then has increased draw calls and can&amp;rsquo;t bundle in draw calls with instances (&lt;em&gt;copies in the level&lt;/em&gt;) of itself.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;A screenshot from inside a Blueprint window inside Unreal 5. The crop shows a part of the &amp;ldquo;Details Panel&amp;rdquo;. It focuses on &amp;ldquo;Transform&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; settings under it. An arrow points at &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; and says &amp;ldquo;Bad!&amp;rdquo; We should use &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; instead.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;245&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;589px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, go into the newly made blueprint with static art set dressings and make sure you set the root and the children geometry inside all as &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;. All solved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;long-explanation&#34;&gt;Long explanation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Blueprints is a smart thing to do. It definitely is the right approach no matter if you are doing level design, mechanics or environment art and set dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even thought a lot of people who start in Unreal for the first time might not see the use of Blueprints past gameplay and mechanics, there is in fact lots to extract from blueprints when doing set dressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making environment art, it can sometimes be slow to work directly into the world, in world space. You create a building and it is placed at an odd angle in the level. Every set dressing that might go onto its exterior, on its façade, you need to place at a similarly odd angle. An easier way to work instead would be to create &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;local space&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. A bundle of assets - the buildings and its façade set dressings - placed in its own coordinates. That is exactly a blueprint. That &amp;ldquo;local space&amp;rdquo; bundle, then like a little template can be placed in the world, at an odd angle. It&amp;rsquo;s creation, through a blueprint, instead of directly working in &amp;ldquo;world space&amp;rdquo; was much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;(Below I made a silly looking house as a quick example. Ignore the fact it doesn&amp;#39;t look amazing. I used Unreal starter project meshes with the idea of illustrating the explanations here a bit better.)&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-001.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from a blank level. In the middle are two identical houses. Left is just meshes in the world, right is meshes that are inside a blueprint instead. A yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;In this pic I&amp;rsquo;ve selected each asset individually. Each asset is placed on its own, and its own odd angle.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;206&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;495px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are working with multiple people and there is version control, this means you don&amp;rsquo;t need to commit changes to the world (the level) next time you want to improve the building. Instead you can edit the blueprint (the local space) and commit that change. The fixes and improvements will automatically propagate to every level where the blueprint was used.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Image identical to before but now the right side house is selected. The one that is a blueprint. An arrow points at the outliner that showcases the assets are not loose anymore but in a bundle. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Second asset selected here is a Blueprint instead. Actors are bundled in a template that is easier to select and move.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this paints a picture of why its &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to work with blueprints in order to build &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;templates&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of environment art and set dressing. In the image below is seen one such template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-003.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from a Blueprint editing window in Unreal 5. It showcases the house and all its set dressings bundled together. Yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;Editing the art in a &amp;ldquo;mini scene&amp;rdquo; like this is much easier tha editing inside the world level.&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do the above, here comes the issue though, and the reason why you might have low performance next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-004.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image like before but now an arrow points to the &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; settings and yellow text reads &amp;ldquo;The template came with default settings through. Those settings are wrong for the use case (environment art set dressing).&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen above, the default settings when making a blueprint will set every static geometry inside to &amp;ldquo;movable&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo;. As mentioned before, that increases draw calls. It&amp;rsquo;s also needless, as these pieces will be used as environment art that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ever move. We can fix it all by changing the mobility back to static, as seen in the next images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Identical to before UE5 blueprint editor screenshot. An orange arrow points to &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; and crosses over &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;, explains that &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; is the correct one. The text is described in the next paragraph.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow text above reads &amp;ldquo;We need to change the mobility from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. This way draw calls will be manageable. In this step we changed the root and next we need to also change the mobility of any meshes under it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/template-actor-006.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;976&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image from the same blueprint. On the left side, in the &amp;ldquo;Components&amp;rdquo; window, in blue are selected lots of children static meshes. Another arrow on the right hand side points again to &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; this time of the selected many children assets. Yellow text is described below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;196&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;471px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Image above instructs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we should select all children under the root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we change their &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; as well. A yellow arrow points to where to do that in the blueprint details panel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save the blueprint file changes and all is done. We are now all optimized on draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With all set to static, all is good and manageable in draw calls. Always pay attention to your mobility settings for new Blueprints and you will not have further performance issues related to the BPs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;moving-drops-and-loot&#34;&gt;Moving Drops and Loot&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve created a little game prototype. It consists mostly of blockout levels without any heavy graphics. You are a person interested in level design, as well as game design for gameplay mechanics and gameplay systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your game prototype world is just the mentioned above: blockouts. You have also added some enemies and simple loot that spawns when the minions die. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ve also scattered and placed some predefined collectables in your level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a collectable to be easily spotted by the player, and for it to look interesting and like we could interact with it, you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to give it a simple animation. Something like the rotation around main pivot point, as seen by the colorful, little gems in Spyro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/spyro-gems.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot from one of the cave levels in Spyro Reignited Trilogy. To the front of the camera is Spyro. Next to him are a green and a blue gem. In the background there is a large spider and to the right of it are two more gems. Those are red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You like rewarding players and giving them sense of satisfaction and progression. As such you shower them in loot. Soon the level you have is packed with lots and lots of rotating in place items. Your FPS is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of the above is the case, and if indeed your performance is low, then the reason might be exactly in the loot. More specifically, in the way you did the simple animation associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways you could approach making this animation. One is through a Blueprint Actor that has moving component that gives the item a rotation on each game tick through the blueprint logic. The second way is through a custom material shader (&lt;em&gt;Material Graph&lt;/em&gt;) that rotates the loot through World Position Offset. There is also a third way, through an animation created in Blender or Maya and imported, but we will ignore that because most students and devs will prefer to do something as simple as rotation around pivot inside the engine itself, instead of going outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your FPS to be down, you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely picked the first option. You&amp;rsquo;ve created your loot as a blueprint that gets placed in a static location in the world. That blueprint then has the logic to rotate the item around, or make it hover up and down. By doing it through the blueprint you&amp;rsquo;ve inadvertently increased your draw calls by causing each placed instance of the loot to be a unique draw call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The culprit here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To make the item animate through a blueprint, you set the geometry to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; game object always ends up in its own draw call;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce hundreds of those. They wont stack into one draw call, they will be hundreds of draw calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If instead you animate the object through the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Material Graph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, using &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;World Position Offset (WPO)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; then your animation will end up being on the GPU. All objects using the material that animates them could be left to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and still visually animate in movement. All of those objects would then bundle in draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would no longer be making hundreds and hundreds of needless draw calls that slow down your CPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your performance will increase. Your FPS will be higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Title is &#34;Rotating Objects in UE4, Benchmarked (Get better FPS!)&#34; by YouTuber &#34;Pending Kill&#34;. The video is an excellent showcase of how one could do the different types of animation and what their performance would be.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video is the best showcase, and explanation, of everything I wrote above. I found it some time ago randomly and was very impressed by the great presentation in it. Give it a watch to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The showcase is in UE4 but the inner workings are the same in UE5. As such if you found yourself making rotating loot, all of this info is still valid. It&amp;rsquo;s also the same way in Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;overlapping-lights&#34;&gt;Overlapping Lights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect that can be incredibly influential over your performance is light. Depending on how you use &amp;ldquo;Point Lights&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Spotlights&amp;rdquo; in your project, you might end up with a lot of overlaps in light that increase the cost of the light actors and drag down your performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter if we are in UE5, UE4 or Unity, we need to be careful with movable, overlapping lights, and we need to be intelligent with the way we place those actors in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The goal is to always keep overlaps in lights low. Light actors should be placed with sensible attenuation radius and should not be stacked over one another, even when they have small radius.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lights-example&#34;&gt;Lights Example&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are talking about lighting that is realistic and looks cinematic and moody, the general artistic comment of &amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo; is even stronger than other mediums of art. As such, if we set up lighting in a smart way, we will get a better artistic visual through using less amount of point lights and spotlights. That will then result in better performance too, thanks to the already mentioned reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lets explore some visual examples of lights overlapping. For that I will take a look at my project &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  title=&#34;_index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;em&gt;check the link to read about its making!&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the comparison images above we first see the final scene. The secondary screenshot overlays on top the billboards of the lights, showcasing their position in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If with the UE5 scene open, we click on the viewport and then we press &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;ALT + 7&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; on the keyboard, we will go into &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. That is an &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization Viewmode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. In the secondary image below, we can see lots of blue, green and red colors. That&amp;rsquo;s the light complexity view mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;font size=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interactive element below. Move the white bar and arrows in the middle to see comparison between two images.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;First is the image seen before - the UE5 scene with the crystal, 2D sprites showing lights toggled. Second image on top is a -Light Complexity- view mode. It shows the scene in flat silhouettes. Those are colored between deep blue, green, yellow, orange, red and purple and white. Each color corresponds to a complexity in the light, dragging performance down. Transcription to what each color represents is in the following paragraph below.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The legend of how to read the view mode comes in the form of the long, color gradient bar in the lower parts of the screen. It reads as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep blues to light blues - little overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green to yellow - medium overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or in flashy, absolutely needless, colors that I spend way too long writing code for, given that I will probably never reuse in the future of this blog &lt;em&gt;(I mean, behold how ugly it is!)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom0&#34;&gt;1. Deep blues to light blues - little overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom1&#34;&gt;2. Green to yellow - medium overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .gradient-text {
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    .gradient-text-custom3 {
        background: linear-gradient(to right, #f66703, #a90019 50%);
        -webkit-background-clip: text;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom3&#34;&gt;3. Orange to deep red - a lot of overlaps;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
    .gradient-text {
        font-size: 20px;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    .gradient-text-custom4 {

        -webkit-background-clip: text;
        color: transparent;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;gradient-text gradient-text-custom4&#34;&gt;4. Purple to white - extremely high amount of overlaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bigger amount of lights affecting a surface (&lt;em&gt;overlapping there&lt;/em&gt;), the more expensive to render that surface becomes. The colors indicate that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue - surface only affected by your Directional Light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green - surface affected by your Dir Light + one more light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red - surface affected by up to 5 different lights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are working on our lighting set up, we want to check this light complexity view mode from time to time. That is in order to track if we get big &amp;ldquo;offenders&amp;rdquo; in overlapping lights. If we see any, we want to select the light and under its settings tweak the &amp;ldquo;Attenuation Radius&amp;rdquo; down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the gif below, we can see me doing exactly that with two point lights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/amarantos-lights-anim.gif&#34;

		alt=&#34;Frame gif animation. Shows a camera angle facing one of the corners of the Amarantos Ritual environment. There are lots of roots and props seen in the first frame. Second frame shows billboards of lights on top. Third frame switches to &amp;ldquo;Light Complexity&amp;rdquo; type of &amp;ldquo;Optimization Viewmode&amp;rdquo;. All the colors go from dark blue to red to white, each indicating bad light complexity through light overlaps.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;364px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note how in the middle of the gif above playing, when spectating the optimization view mode, the colors change from purples and whites to bit more reds. That is the frame where I selected two Point Lights. They had &amp;ldquo;Attenuation Radius&amp;rdquo; setting of 300. I toned them down to a radius of 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you observe the change between the final frame and the first one, you see before-and-after. Indeed there is a difference in how the lighting looks. But the lesson here is that there are lots of situation in which you might needlessly have a large amount of attenuation radius. If you go into the setting and dial it down slowly, you might see that the first many numbers you go down through might not change the visual at all. But in the background, it will change the overlap in light and it will optimize your scene further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lights-art-control&#34;&gt;Lights Art Control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets mention the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;less is more&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; part again though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to point out once more, that when we have less amount of lights in a scene, they are actually artistically easier to direct and control. As such a well lit, moody and beautiful scene, will more often be build up of the elegance of a few large lights, as opposed to a constellation of many tiny lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep that in mind and study movies and cinematic direction in order to learn how to see the simplicity and elegance of use of light in broad strokes, instead of tiny ones. That will make you better at lighting as art, but it will coincidentally make your scenes more optimized as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference is queen here so you always want to find good photographs and movie stills to base your lighting work off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;baked-lights&#34;&gt;Baked Lights&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more old-fashioned lighting set up, where one relies on stationary lights that will be baked, overlapping lights might not be nearly as big of an issue. That set up is commonly seen in UE4 and Unity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As already explored, in a more modern lighting set up, where nearly all of the lights are movable and will not be baked at all, overlapping lights can have a detrimental affect on your performance. This lighting set up is what we most commonly see in UE5 and Lumen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you project is in UE5, if you are a student that is looking to expand their knowledge and find their first break into the industry, I would say that its worth looking up how to create good lightmaps for assets. Those lightmaps will then allow you, with the right settings, to bake most of your lights in your scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of next gen games that are build in UE5 don&amp;rsquo;t use baked lights. But lots of games still use baked lights (&lt;em&gt;for example most projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on over at Rebellion&lt;/em&gt;). The technique is incredibly good and beneficial, with little drawbacks to the art and big wins in the performance, when done the right way. As such its something commonly found in lots of studios out there and you having some knowledge in it will put you ahead of a lot of other candidates that might compete with you in a job search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;gpu-profiling-tool&#34;&gt;GPU Profiling Tool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see how well, or bad, your lights are performing directly into the GPU profiler tool that Unreal provides as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/gpu-profiler-001.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;UE5 screenshot from the scene seen before. This time around on top of the UI is overlaid a new window. It&amp;rsquo;s called GPU Visualizer and it lists a few things. One is &amp;ldquo;Scene&amp;rdquo; that is then followed by multi colored bar. Each color represents different cost. An orange annotation arrow points at a green section and a text annotation says &amp;ldquo;Press the green bar to see &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; info.&amp;rdquo;. Explanation how to open this entire window is in the paragraphs below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool is incredibly beneficial as it lists the costs to anything that ends up on the GPU. In the cases where you know that your graphics are dragging you down, and that you might be GPU-bound, you can use that screen to analyze what needs improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the time we clicked the Unreal cmd in the lower left corner of the screen to type &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo; we can now use it to instead call this GPU tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click the cmd and type &amp;ldquo;Profile GPU&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;l&#34;&gt;profile gpu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;w&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then hit &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. The profiler window will open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first image above, we can see that there is a long bar colored in different regions. Each of those represents a different cost that is on the GPU. Hovering over the teal-green colored section in my case, I saw that its listed as &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on that and it expanded into the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/draw-call-tips-students-art-level-design/gpu-profiler-002.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1344&#34;
	height=&#34;925&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Same screenshot as before but now the teal-green section of the multi-color bar is highlighted. That has expanded a lower portion of the screen that lists &amp;ldquo;Lights &amp;ndash; Direct Lighting &amp;ndash; Unbatched Lights&amp;rdquo;. In there are lots of Point Lights. Each has a different cost listed as duration (ms) on the right side. Yellow text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selecting to take a closer look at the lights, we can see them listed in the category below. If the &lt;strong&gt;ms&lt;/strong&gt; listed in this category is very high, then the performance is bad and your FPS will be low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the lights, this tool allows you to nicely observe if there are other performance issues as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example from an old project of mine is one time when I was having incredibly poor FPS. I ran the GPU Profiler Viz and I could see that the &amp;ldquo;Hair Groom&amp;rdquo; actors associated with my Metahuman in the scene was giving incredibly hard time to my GTX 1070. I disabled the hair, put a helmet on the metahuman, and started saving up for a newer gen GPU that could handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this lengthy blog post, we explore common reasons for low performance in projects. That is in both environment art projects and level design blockouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at some ideas of how to handle and fix the issues. We explored draw calls, static meshes and BSP brushes. We looked at how to convert BSP brushes into static meshes that are more manageable in draw calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we looked at blueprints actors and how faulty default settings might cause high draw calls. From there we went into animating simple drop. Finally we explored lights and what overlapping lights are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooling that we explored, like the &amp;ldquo;scenerendering&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GPU profiler&amp;rdquo; are incredibly powerful. I mentioned some ways to look at those and analyze your work. The screens list lots and lots more useful data though. It&amp;rsquo;s data that is too much to explore in a single blog post. As such I shall leave you to analyze and perfect your performance further by looking at all of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final thing that I would like to mention, that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get the time to cover in this post either, is that what we do in blueprints when it comes to scripting and to logic behind implementing gameplay, can of course, also affect performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such make sure you not only spend your energy profiling your graphics, but try to optimize and make sure the logic of your blueprints, code and gameplay is also well created.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 11 - Crystal Prop Breakdown</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Nov 2023 21:01:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/amarantos026.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 11 - Crystal Prop Breakdown" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foreword&#34;&gt;Foreword&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the final screenshots of my “&lt;em&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/em&gt;” environment last week. Along with those, I also created some props showcase and breakdown images. In &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-004/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;The Amarantos Ritual - 04 - Crystal Sculpt&lt;/a&gt;, I already covered quite a bit of insight and behind-the-scenes early images of how I approached creating the geometry for the Nanite crystal. I also showed many screenshots of the progress on the texturing and my reasoning behind the way I approached it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other ten entries of “&lt;em&gt;The Amarantos Ritual&lt;/em&gt;” dev blogs, I showed and told you about everything I wanted when it comes to this project. There are even few parts that are tutorials. As such, I am wrapping up the series. Even though the “Crystal Sculpt” blog above is very detailed, I thought I would create this as a supplement blog to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such if you are interested in creating a crystal prop like it, go over and read entry four, &amp;ldquo;Crystal Sculpt&amp;rdquo;, above and then come back here and complement your knowledge with the additional four image breakdowns on the topic. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s informative and insightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots&#34;&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some screenshots of the final result. This is what we will be inspecting a breakdown of in the images to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;breakdown&#34;&gt;Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text and breakdown behind each image is transcribed below &lt;em&gt;(which was another reason I made this blog post - to transcribe the text for better accessibility)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;An image collage with seven images and breakdown text explanations next to each. First image shows an albedo view in Substance Painter. The crystal prop is seen. It consists of a rock ball and attached blue crystals on the south and north pole of the sphere. The next two images showcase the rock ball UVs and next to it the crystals UVs that look like lots of tiny rectangles. Below is an image where the prop is shaded in flat red and flat green. Red is crystal shards, green is the rock orb. The text explanations are transcribed in the paragraph below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crystal prop has two material IDs. 1/ Red color - crystal shards. 2/ Green color - rock orb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither utilize high- to low-poly bake or normal bakes. Both benefit from AO and curvature bake. Those were made by baking “low on low” &lt;em&gt;(in this case we are talking about a dense Nanite mesh)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance Painter work for crystal (red) includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;triplanar mapping of some base color noises (the liquid-spill shapes);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hand polish by painting seams and liquid-spill parts that didn’t come out looking detailed even with triplanar mapping;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AO multiplied into the base color for an extra punch of darkness detail;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roughness variation derived from AO and curvature bakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substance Painter work for crystal (green) includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordinary PBR texturing utilizing normal noise from rock texture, base color, AO and roughness. Blue shards attached to it were masked by hand too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image above then shows a close up of the blue crystal, rendered in UE5. Text next to it reads:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal UVs all point in a uniform direction. That way any tiling detail normals / roughness and other channels used in UE5 would get the best appearance. Texel density is uniform too. UVs were created and polished by hand. Laid out with UV Packmaster 2. (Blender)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final two images in the picture above then show an albedo close up of the patterns painted on the crystal. In the first image there are seams, in the second one they are painted away. Text next to those reads:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before (left) and after (right). An example of a quick by hand painting to improve seams.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Second image collage. On the top right corner is the same red and green mask as before. Below it is a large rendering of the crystal rendered in UE5. It showcases intricate, blue and aquamarine shards. They have splashes of purple and deep sea blue here and there. Next are two images that showcase the UVs as seen before but now rendered in an UE5 shader. Next, to the very right, is a view of both materials properties. That lists lots and lots of parameters like Tiling, Textures, Masks, Opacity, Emission, Normals, Panners, etc. Text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal material ID (red) seen in this shot &lt;em&gt;(blue image above with white splash in the middle)&lt;/em&gt;. This one is the more detailed and a special one. It tiles a micro and a macro normals as well as a roughness tiled channel. In addition it has two fresnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock orb material ID (green) seen in this shot &lt;em&gt;(gray image above)&lt;/em&gt;. Is ordinary PBR with nothing special going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-011/amarantos_ritual_breakdown_peter_dimitrov_038.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;3840&#34;
	height=&#34;2160&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another image collage (third one). Here there are 5 purple screenshots. They show different parts of the crystal prop that is now tinted in green and teal hues. The background of the scene is in deep purples. This slide showcases the fresnels used in the shaders. If one zooms close onto the green crystal and compares the different images, the fresnels can be seen giving bright contour and extra dimension to the artwork. Yellow arrows point on a screenshot of the material settings and the different parameters. Text is transcribed below.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresnel[1] off (top left). Fresnel[1] on (top right). This is the inverted fresnel. Gives crystal shine from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresnel[2] off (bottom first image in collage above). Fresnel[2] on (bottom second image in collage above). Is not inverted. Has lower power but more obvious color. Gives the colorful edges (noticeable from both close and far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Fresnels add lots of detail. They work especially well with the Nanite geometry. Seen to the left is an edge that exists in the geo but is mostly invisible and flat when colored with only an albedo. When an inverted Fresnel is added, that edge is especially pronounced and gives the visuals more dimensionality.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Final, fourth, image collage. This one shows three textures. Two are normals and one is linear mask. The first normal map seen has large, macro detail gaussian dots and circular scratches. The second normal map has micro details on it although the shapes seen are much more obvious and are large crystal matrix surface patterns. The black and white, linear mask looks like a gaussian clouds mixed with moisture noise (Substance Designer). All three maps are tiling. Next to each there is explanation, transcribed below. Lastly an image looks at the close up patters of the crystal and explains the emission and animation that goes there (also transcribed below).&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-normal-1&#34;&gt;Tiling Normal [1]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first tiled normal detail acts mostly as macro detail. Thats in the form of gaussian dots and circular scratches. They appear large in their shape and tiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-normal-2&#34;&gt;Tiling Normal [2]&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second tiled normal detail acts mostly as micro detail. It gives the surface a crystal matrix pattern. It might look large on the left, but you can see on the right that its tiled over 28 times &lt;em&gt;(making it tiny)&lt;/em&gt;. My favourite part with this one is that when the camera goes further away and the texture mipmaps to a lower level, it gives the crystal a dotted, sparking visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-roughness&#34;&gt;Tiling Roughness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in page 1 &lt;em&gt;(thats image one)&lt;/em&gt;, the crystal has unique albedo, roughness and metallic. These are seen here: &lt;em&gt;(green arrow points to albedo and AO_R_M texture slots in the material)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that not only the normals could benefit from tiling noise but that the roughness could get a bit of detail as well. As such this bitmap seen to the left, I multiplied into the AO_R_M of the crystal to give more richness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;emission-and-animations&#34;&gt;Emission and Animations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the very top group in the image above you can see lots of parameters relating to emission. They have one underlying design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ In Painter mask parts of the “liquid spill albedo”. Use that as unique “EmissiveMask” above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Tile a big gaussian noise. (EmissivePannerMask)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Pan the noise in U and V direction, giving an animated look. (PanX and PanY Speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are hard to show here and can be observed in the videos &lt;em&gt;(seen in albums below)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artstation-albums&#34;&gt;Artstation Albums&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the images above, and many more, in 4k, over at my Artstation. I ended up creating three albums as I could organize the tons of screenshots better that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Shows a UE5 cinematic video. The crystal prop and the environment are part of that.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also see some behind the scenes images on the topic of the cinematic over at Hayley&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hayleyrumbold.com/theamarantosritual?&amp;#43;=&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four images showed a breakdown of how I accomplished to create a detailed crystal prop inside Unreal 5. The different pieces that make up the final visual were taken apart. Comparison of some effects being on and off were shown. Some of the bitmaps used were also previewed. With all of that, hopefully you learned something new and got ideas and inspiration of how to approach the geometry and texture work when it comes to your own props.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/vortexvfxindex/vortexvfx-c.png" alt="Featured image of post Vortex VFX Tutorial - Index" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial series, we will create a vortex VFX basin in Unreal 5. We will go to the creation of geometry, textures and shaders needed for it. Finally we will take a look at blueprints and how to use them to improve the efficiency of our game assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is in 5 parts. This blog page will index those pages and list them for an easier look at all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;

        <title>The Amarantos Ritual - 09 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Five (Optional)</title>
        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos182-c.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 09 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Five (Optional)" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lets use a Blueprint Actor with extended Construction Script logic in order to improve our work practices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have went through all four previous entries of this tutorial series. We have created the geometry, textures and then shaders necessary for getting the nice visual end result. We could leave it there. The VFX vision is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is one final, optional step I wanted to run you through. It&amp;rsquo;s the set up of a custom Blueprint Actor and a few lines of Construction Script node logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to remind yourself of the previous tutorial steps, you can do so over here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part One - Creating Static Geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Two - Creating Textures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Four - Adding Refraction Shader and Assembling The Final VFX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As in all parts of this tutorial series, I am working in UE5.3. If you are inside UE4, you can still follow along and should not have any issues replicating any part.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with what you have, you can skip this final part. If you want to learn more about Blueprints and Unreal, stick around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a reminded of what we have accomplished so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the visual result and the set up of our work so far. The VFX vortex basin looks cool. It looks how we wanted it. I have a &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; with a part of its set up that has nothing to do with the visuals though. I say &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; because its not a large issue per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more about efficiency than about any &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. There is an overall lack of efficiency that shows up in a few ways. Lets look over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-bundled&#34;&gt;Not Bundled&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a started, our VFX basin is composed of four pieces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static vortex mesh with base color.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Static vortex mesh copy with refraction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Middle small static mesh plane to fix imperfection.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cylinder static mesh frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As such whenever I want to copy my visual into a new level, or make a duplicate in the existing level, I have to select all one by one, as seen in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos149.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1716&#34;
	height=&#34;982&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot of a scene. Four static meshes - plane, two vfx vortex basins and a cylinder are selected. That can be seen in the Hierarchy view on the right of the screen, where the pieces are selected in blue highlighter.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine a hypothetical situation where this asset is used in a full production game, where lots of artist work on the game. First, selecting one by one four assets, whenever you want to move things around is inefficient. Second, having to &amp;ldquo;instruct&amp;rdquo; and have other artists remember about your edge case VFX where its split into four pieces is also quite inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a solution to that. It is to turn the four pieces into a bundle. Into a Blueprint Actor. We will do that and cover the necessary steps. Any artist, designer or a programmer that later on has to work with this VFX basin, add functionality or do tweaks, will be thankful to us for bundling it properly into an actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hard-to-change-color&#34;&gt;Hard to Change Color&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you remember from the previous steps, we made our main material shader so we can tint the VFX into any color we like. That is the reason why in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;part two&lt;/a&gt; of the tutorial series we left the &amp;ldquo;albedo&amp;rdquo; liquid-spill texture black and white - so we could tint it in engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, lets imagine another hypothetical situation with a game in full production. Let us say that this VFX basin is used as a portal or as some fundamental for gameplay function. As such it will exist everywhere. Lots of copies in each world. Also lets say that for visual variety, or even better, for design functionality, we have created a big array of lots of colored versions of this VFX basin. Its not going to be just blue, purple and green like the previews above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead its going to be blue, purple, green, violet, pink, red, yellow, cyan, a shade of black, a shade of white, and more. Also lets imagine that new artists or designers joining might want newer shades of colors, so they suddenly create even more. Our Content Browser ends up like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos150.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1603&#34;
	height=&#34;412&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the Content Drawer (project directory) of UE5. 9 files are visible which have similar icons but are all different colors. Those are 9 copies of the same material instance - the polar coordinates from the previous blog parts - tinted in all kinds of hues.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;389&#34;

&lt;p&gt;I had the patience to make only 9 material instances to illustrate this point. But imagine there being 18, or 25 or even 30 material instances. Believe me, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen productions at previous game dev jobs I&amp;rsquo;ve had where this thing happens. I didn&amp;rsquo;t name the instances properly either - instead of having a color in the name, they just go _Inst1&amp;hellip;Inst2&amp;hellip;InstN. and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that in studios out there too &lt;em&gt;(make sure to always name things properly)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make something more efficient and eliminate the two issues above, we can create a Blueprint Actor. In it, all static meshes will be into a collection, which fixes problem one. Then in the Construction Script of the blueprint, we can use few nodes of logic in order to make it so we have exposed and customizable color per blueprint actor instance once placed in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will end up with this.&lt;/p&gt;

If we look at the left side of the screen, we can see all 4 static meshes are listed. If we look at the right side, we will see a &amp;ldquo;Base Color&amp;rdquo; tinted in blue. That controls the color per actor instance basis, dynamically.&#34;

&lt;p&gt;In your project directory, make a folder called &amp;ldquo;Blueprints&amp;rdquo;. Inside of it, right click to create a new asset. Under &amp;ldquo;Create Basic Asset&amp;rdquo;, select &amp;ldquo;Blueprint Class&amp;rdquo;. In the window that pops up, select the top option button, called &amp;ldquo;Actor&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the static mesh you created in the first part of this tutorial series. From the &amp;ldquo;Content Drawer&amp;rdquo; drag it into the Blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the newly added mesh. On the right hand side panel, first change the &amp;ldquo;Mobility&amp;rdquo; from &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. Then click on the Material and find your vortex material instance, the one that has default white color tint on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our material instance that we edit through the construction script, we can also see our &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; parameter.

    &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;From all of the descriptions and material vs construction script images you see above, you hopefully learned that we need to be careful and track exactly how we name our parameters inside of the material graph. We then use the names inside of our new blueprints, as exactly seen over in the material. If in your material you named your Base Tint to something different, then don&amp;#39;t copy that name from me, instead use the name you came up with back when you were making your material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-variable&#34;&gt;New Variable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all pins connected and with the &amp;ldquo;Parameter Name&amp;rdquo; of the &amp;ldquo;Set Vector&amp;rdquo; node put correctly, now lets create a new Blueprint Variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the (+) sign seen below to add a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos173.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1919&#34;
	height=&#34;1150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;We are back to the blueprint construction scrip board and this image showcases it. An arrow to the left points at a plus sign next to &amp;ldquo;VARIABLES&amp;rdquo;. Clicking it starts making a new variable that by default has red color that indicates a Boolean type.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly created variable, name &amp;ldquo;BaseColor&amp;rdquo;. You can do so by selecting the &amp;ldquo;NewVar&amp;rdquo; red boolean and then changing its name on the panel in the right hand side. From &amp;ldquo;Variable Type&amp;rdquo; over in that corner, search for &amp;ldquo;Linear Color&amp;rdquo; and set it to that. The red boolean indicator will turn into a dark blue Linear Color indicator. From the settings over there also turn on &amp;ldquo;Instance Editable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instance Editable turned on, in the settings there, is very important as that is what will let us change the color when we drag a blueprint instance in the open world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos174.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1152&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE5 screenshot that has an arrow pointing to the right hand panel. In that side are lots of settings like variable name, variable type, and others. We tweak those as described above.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag &amp;ldquo;BaseColor&amp;rdquo; from the left side onto the board. From the context menu that shows and asks if you want to &amp;ldquo;Get&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Set&amp;rdquo; the Base Color, pick &amp;ldquo;Get. The node seen below will show up. Connect Base Color node pin into &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Set Vector Parameter Value on Material&amp;rdquo; node seen below. It will do a conversion for us &lt;em&gt;(seen in the picture after the next one)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos175.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1152&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot that shows the result of Base Color dragged onto the board - a dark blue Base Color pin shows up. The image then shows us dragging its pin out and connecting it into the &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;Set Vector&amp;rdquo; large node. With that a little text appears, with a red and blue icon, that says &amp;ldquo;Convert Linear Color Structure to Vector&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything should look like above after the new conversion pin &lt;em&gt;(the one going from dark blue to dark orange and then connecting into &amp;ldquo;Parameter Value&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos176.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Blueprint board screenshot that shows our nodes work so far. Our dark blue node called Base Color connects into a dark orange conversion node that has no name visually. That then connects into Parameter Value of the large node &amp;ldquo;Set Vector Parameter&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When we made our variable, instead of going for Linear Color we could have gone for Vector 3. That Vector 3 would have technically been a color - one with no alpha of course - that then directly connects above without needing a conversion node. When exposed, the Vector 3 would have X, Y and Z value and would not give us interface with a color picker, which is not ideal. Us using a Linear Color structure instead and then converting it to Vector 3 allows us to have a nice color picker which makes it more artist / user friendly. We will see that picker in action in a few pictures down this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;ldquo;BaseColor&amp;rdquo; from here (&lt;em&gt;the left side panel)&lt;/em&gt; again. Click on the black box on the right side panel to change the default color. I put mine to blue. That color picked seen here would not have worked had we not done it the way the green &amp;ldquo;Tip&amp;rdquo; box above describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos177.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1917&#34;
	height=&#34;1150&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another screenshot that now shows the Base Color selected and its right hand side settings change. The black box there is clicked and then change to a bright blue color, using a color picker seen in the image.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;166&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;400px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are done with the Blueprint set up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-a-level&#34;&gt;In A Level&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag our newly finished blueprint into the scene. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos178.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1908&#34;
	height=&#34;1014&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;A screenshot that shows a viewport looking at a blank UE5 level that comes with the default skybox, volumetric clouds and a plane with checkerboard material. In one corner, closest to the camera we have dragged in our newly created blueprint. It looks like a blue vortex.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;188&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;451px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now duplicate the newly placed blue vortex blueprint. Move it to the side. From the right &amp;ldquo;Details&amp;rdquo; menu of UE5 change the color &lt;em&gt;(this is the Base Color variable that we implemented)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos179.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1913&#34;
	height=&#34;1043&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Image that has identical to before subject and angle. Now next to the blue vortex blueprint that is out in the world, there is a secondary one. This secondary one has its Base Color blueprint variable changed to a pink, red color. That is reflected in the world too, where the material instance used on that dynamically has changed to the same shade of red.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;183&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;440px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate your blueprint as many times. Set as many different colors you want. All of the materials are dynamic and are saved inside the level itself. As such our Project Directory is tidy and not overflowed with lots of material instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos180.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;904&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another UE5 blank level screenshot. Angle is same as before but now most of the before empty space is occupied by many vortex basins. There are blue, red, purple, green, yellow, white, teal and many more colors.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;133&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;320px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;color-previews&#34;&gt;Color Previews&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one final view of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/amarantos181.jpg&#34;

	height=&#34;1125&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot similar to the previous one but now the camera is slightly from afar and orthographic looking. A line of six colored vortex, all different is put out. On a second line below, five more sit.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this optional part of the VFX tutorial for creating a vortex basin, we looked at Blueprint set ups. We learned how to bundle our few different static meshes so they are more artist friendly and efficient to use. We then looked into using construction script in order to connect a linear color blueprint parameter into the material used on the vortex. That allowed us to efficiently change the color of each unique vortex blueprint instance, once put in the world, without having to make unique material instances in our project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed reading and going through this tutorial series. I had a lot of fun putting it together and I sincerely hope it comes to be useful and educational for anyone reading it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me around a month and lots of hours after work to write this all up. It was a lot of effort to create all of the images, annotate them on top step by step, and give them alt text. I think we totalled to around 180 images. As such if you would like to drop a tip over at my Ko-fi page, I would be very grateful. You can find it in the blue badge link below. Alternatively you could purchase the asset itself from my shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Blue, purple and green one. Text on top reads Click here to buy the UE5 assets for this VFX over at Ko-fi.&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Refraction Material Shader in UE5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we created the Polar Coordinates / Circular Distortion material shader in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;previous entry&lt;/a&gt; of this tutorial series, we will now add a secondary layer of detail on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be in the shape of a refraction effect that will sit above the polar coordinates material of the vortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just now tuning in and would like to accomplish the visuals seen in the previews below, make sure to go over the previous entries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part One - Creating Static Geometry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Two - Creating Textures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like in the previous tutorial part, I will be creating the parent material in Unreal Engine 5. If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3. You can use any previous ones though, as already mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, lets see the final preview of everything:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we&amp;rsquo;ve created the geometry, the textures and the moving, syphon-inwards material graph. Now we will create the refraction material to go on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are screenshot previews as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;refraction-preview&#34;&gt;Refraction Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the main visual already created - the circular vortex shader - we can now add another slice of detail to go on top. That will be in the shape of a refraction material that is mostly transparent. It will sit on a secondary copy of the base vortex basin static mesh. This copied static mesh will be moved slightly up in space so it floats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at refraction is a bit hard in static screenshots. It&amp;rsquo;s an effect that is much more visible in movement. However, here is a screenshot where if you look closely in the upper right corner of the cylindrical basin of the green vortex, you can notice the refraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos128.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Unreal 5 screenshot where a close up of the different colored VFX vortex basins is seen. The one closest to the camera, the green one, is observed to have broken, cells like appearance. That is due to the refraction shader.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;289&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;695px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refraction picks up colors from the rest of the scene. As such the warm gray color cells we see, above the green vortex, are not artifacts or transparent parts of the polar material. Instead its a refraction material put on a high value, picking up and refracting the rest of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might look a bit odd, and perhaps ugly, from this close up, at this high value. I have put it to an intensity overly high just to showcase it. In our final result it will be much more subtle and work with the vortex in a much better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos129.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock warning&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Note:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I have Pan U Refraction and Pan V Refraction scalars above. The ones going into the Panner node. I ended up not using those. You can either skip that part and have your TexCoord - Multiply - go directly into UVs of Normal Refraction, or you could follow and recreate it. I added them at first because I thought it might be useful to animate the refraction slightly in one direction. I ended up not using it. Perhaps you might want to try it and personalize your visual with it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-the-refraction-graph&#34;&gt;Creating the Refraction Graph&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the part of your Unreal Project Directory where you have a folder where you keep your Parent materials. Right click and create a new one. Name it &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change &amp;ldquo;Blend Mode&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Translucent&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;Shading Model&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Unlit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tiling-refraction&#34;&gt;Tiling Refraction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click and search for a &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;(or hold down &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard and press anywhere to instantly add one)&lt;/em&gt;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Position it like below. Next search for &amp;ldquo;Texture Coordinates&amp;rdquo; and add one below the &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Hold down &amp;ldquo;M&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard and then left mouse click anywhere on the screen to add a &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Connect the A of it into &amp;ldquo;Tiling Refraction&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; into TexCoord[0].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;panner-optional&#34;&gt;Panner &lt;em&gt;(Optional)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the yellow note box at the start of this article, this part for creating a moving panner is optional. You could skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Time&amp;rdquo; and add it in here. Add two &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameters&amp;rdquo; and name them &amp;ldquo;Pan U Refraction&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pan V Refraction&amp;rdquo;. After them add &amp;ldquo;AppendMany&amp;rdquo; node and Connect R and G of it as seen in the image below. &lt;em&gt;(&amp;ldquo;Pan U Refraction&amp;rdquo; goes in &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Pan V Refraction&amp;rdquo; goes in &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &amp;ldquo;Panner&amp;rdquo; connect each pin like seen below. Search for &amp;ldquo;TextureSampleParameter2D&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Normal Refraction&amp;rdquo;. From the settings set it to Normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We said that the above Panner with its Time and two scalar parameters are optional. The TextureSampleParameter2D that we renamed to Normal Refraction is not optional (its mandatory). We need that even if we skip adding Panner. If you skipped it, revisit the previous image.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new scalar parameter. Name it &amp;ldquo;Refraction Amount&amp;rdquo;. Search and add a &amp;ldquo;Linear Interpolate&amp;rdquo; from under &amp;ldquo;Maths&amp;rdquo; category. Connect &amp;ldquo;Refraction Amount&amp;rdquo; into the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; of the Lerp. In its &amp;ldquo;Alpha&amp;rdquo; connect the &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; chanel of the normal map &lt;em&gt;(Normal Refraction)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect all of it &lt;em&gt;(the result of the Lerp)&lt;/em&gt; into the Refraction (IOR) in the final material input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Select all of the nodes below. Press &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. Name the newly created frame &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; and give it a blue color (or whatever color you like). Repositions your nodes inside so its more tidy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; and name it &amp;ldquo;Opacity&amp;rdquo;. Connect it into the &amp;ldquo;Opacity&amp;rdquo; of the end material input. If you wish, frame it with a comment in red color.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all done with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;material-instance&#34;&gt;Material Instance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to your &amp;ldquo;Content Browser&amp;rdquo; and find your parent material that we just created. The &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction&amp;rdquo;. Right click on the asset and from the new context menu select one of the top options that reads &amp;ldquo;Create Material Instance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rename the resulting instance from &amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Refraction_Inst&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following settings &lt;em&gt;(yours might appear in a different order because we didn&amp;rsquo;t group them, but that is okay)&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type=&#34;1&#34;&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Pan U Refraction: 0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pan V Refraction: 0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tiling Refraction: 0.007108&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normal Refraction (texture): crystal_surfaces_normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The final one, the texture, is this one which you should have imported in your project already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos139.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it, then you can revisit the second tutorial of this series where we create the texture in Substance Designer. Find it over here &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part Two - Creating The Necessary Textures&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;applying-the-material-on-a-mesh&#34;&gt;Applying The Material on a Mesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets go back in an open scene where we have placed the vortex mesh basin and the polar coordinates material on it, as seen in the previous tutorial step - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part Three - Making Polar Coordinates Shader in UE5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this (below). Im focusing on a version not tinted in blue, purple or green, but you can focus on whichever you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos140.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duplicate the mesh. Move the new copy a few millimeters up in Z direction (thats on the blue axis). It should float slightly above the old mesh seen below. It should all look a bit like the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the material of the floating mesh above to the &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; material instance we just made &lt;em&gt;(that is &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Refraction_Inst_A&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	height=&#34;796&#34;

		alt=&#34;Image identical to before but now the top static mesh has the refraction material applied. It gives everything a more watery appearance now.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;149&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;357px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final step I went into Blender and made myself a hollow cylinder that is near the diameter of the vortex static mesh and protrudes outwards - that makes it a frame. I put that around my VFX to give it a finalized appearance and have it sit more like a hole or a well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos143.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE5 screenshot like before but now the VFX liquid basin, the refraction copy on top too, are framed through a gray, hollow, cylinder.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;152&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;365px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t cover the making of this cylinder because I trust you could make one yourself. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to go out of UE5 and into Maya or Blender, you could perhaps make your cylinder straight into UE5 using the Basic Brush geometry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look straight from above, you will see that in the dead middle of the basin, there is UV distortion that breaks the visuals a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos144.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The VFX meshes seen from above. Looking right in the middle we can see that there is UV distortion that makes the effect look a bit broken there.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;135&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;325px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could revisit the mesh and try to fix this in Blender, but I have a quicker and easier way that could potential look better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &amp;ldquo;Quickly Add To The Project&amp;rdquo; context menu, navigate to &amp;ldquo;Shapes&amp;rdquo; and then click on &amp;ldquo;Plane&amp;rdquo; to add one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos145.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1543&#34;
	height=&#34;1116&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;UE5 project screenshot where we click on a button that looks like a white cube with a plus sign. It opens a contextual menu where we navigate to &amp;ldquo;Shapes&amp;rdquo; and from under there we select &amp;ldquo;Plane&amp;rdquo; that sits under &amp;ldquo;Cone&amp;rdquo; and other types of primitives.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;138&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;331px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Position the newly added plane to the middle. It should sit just above the polar coordinates static mesh (so it hides the issue we have).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos146.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1240&#34;
	height=&#34;917&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another screenshot that shows a white plane added. It&amp;rsquo;s relatively small and its been moved so it sits in the middle of the VFX vortex static mesh basin.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;135&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;324px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the plane selected, change its material to the Polar Coordinates one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/amarantos147.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1648&#34;
	height=&#34;1009&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;The same plane as seen before, is now selected and its material is changed to use the Polar Coordinates colored one. This hides the imperfection that we were getting and the UV distortion.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;163&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;391px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wish, scale your plane up to personalize your visual by having the polar material on it be a bit larger that way. I personally left mine at xyz scale of 1,1,1 as it was seen in the previous step. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you. Just make sure if you scale it up to not have it go outside of the hollow cylinder, breaking the illusion and clipping outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All done! Congrats on following through with this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this final step of the tutorial series we went over creating a refraction material graph shader. We then applied that on a mesh that sits a few millimeters above our previous static mesh basin, giving it a secondary level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this tutorial we wrap up all visuals work on this. In the next, optional part, we will look over Blueprints functionality in UE5 / UE4 and how we can create an Actor that lets us change the color tint per instance basis, when used in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made yourself a VFX basin and picked a color tint you like, you can skip this next part. If you, however, wish to learn more about good practices with Blueprint Actors and how to use Construction Scripts in order to create more powerful set dressing actors, stick around for the next one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-009-tut05/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Improving the efficiency of our work through Blueprints and Constructions Scripts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

        <link>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 19:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos100-c.png" alt="Featured image of post The Amarantos Ritual - 07 - Vortex VFX Tutorial - Part Three" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creating Polar Coordinates / Circular Distortion in UE5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we cover how to make an Unreal 5 material shader VFX. There are two other parts in this tutorial series. In &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-005-tut01/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part One&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; we created the base static geometry needed for the VFX. Then in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-006-tut02/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;&amp;ldquo;Part Two&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; we created some textured noises in Substance Designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this third part, we will use the textures created inside an Unreal 5 Material Graph. First we will created the &amp;ldquo;parent&amp;rdquo; material, then we will copy an instance of it and tweak the values of the different scalars and parameters and get the visual that we see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software that we will be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unreal Engine 5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blender&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substance Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In this third part, I will be created the parent material in Unreal Engine 5. If your project is in Unreal Engine 4, you can still follow. The tutorial does not use any material graph nodes or features that are locked to UE5. Everything is available in UE4 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are curious for the exact version of my engine, I will be using UE5.3. You can use any previous ones though, as already mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, before we go into UE5 and start working, lets see a reminder of what the end result will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;videos-preview&#34;&gt;Videos Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4y6RyrYRb0o&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the final vortex VFX we will be creating.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous two parts of the tutorial we made the geometry and the textures, now we will create the main part - the shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;
    &lt;iframe loading=&#34;lazy&#34; 
            src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mFvhWQ9ot0M&#34; 
            allowfullscreen 
            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above. Shows the VFX basin duplicated three times. One is blue, the other is purple, the last one is green.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;screenshots-preview&#34;&gt;Screenshots Preview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen before, here are screenshot previews:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said in the previous entries, we are making only the VFX, not the rest of the room or art, but you can read about the creation process of those over &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/categories/amarantos-ritual/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

The camera is from very, very far away and unrealistically small Field of View (or otherwise large Focal Length), reducing the perspective and showcasing the props as if from an orthographic view.&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;polar-coordinates&#34;&gt;Polar Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get into creating our UE5 material graph, I want to take a moment and talk about the shader itself. The technique we are after is UV distortion and tiling that with a panner makes a movement towards a central point. Like a vortex. This effect is accomplished through &amp;ldquo;polar coordinates&amp;rdquo;. It is all UV coordinates distortion. We feed in an ordinary tiling texture and we manipulate its UVs to get a circular, inwards motion (or outwards, we can change direction just through one parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very simple, short explanation of what exactly we are doing is the following. We take linear direction coordinates: on the U and V axis and we use maths to distort them into circular coordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;The material shader, seen in an orthographic camera screenshot from Unreal 5. There are three shapes. One is flat plane, second is a vortex basin, third one is the same. First two have black and white, liquid-like texturing. Third one is tinted in green.&#34;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-other-games&#34;&gt;In Other Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above explained technique is incredibly powerful. It&amp;rsquo;s not hard to create and its not very demanding resources wise (&lt;em&gt;it scales on the GPU, which is always a good thing for performance in games&lt;/em&gt;). As such its very commonly seen in games. That is both in old and new titles. Both in AAA and indie games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such I wanted to show you a few examples that I came across randomly, without searching, while I was playing some games recently. That will help you see the elegance of the technique we are about to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diablo-iv&#34;&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Diablo 4 that I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing quite a bit at the time of writing this, there are a few world bosses. The map gets a pin with a timer that gives you 30 minutes to get to a special zone where the boss entity will spawn. Lots of players gather there and if you are early you get to see a few different animations and effects that show the &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;preparation&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; of the spawning of the giant enemy you are about to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Ashava the Pestilent is about to spawn, their presence in Saraan Caldera is announced by this large, toothed mesh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut showing Ashava the Pestilent spawn mesh in the zone Saraan Caldera in Diablo 4.&#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Video embedded above. Shows a clip from Diablo 4 that shows a flesh, bones and tooths-like giant 3D mesh. In the middle there is a flat plane with a vortex VFX motion that moves outwards, as if some miasma, tar and poison moves.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look past the mesh and its movement, and focus on the middle, you will see a flat plane with a VFX material applied to it. That material is absolutely identical to the one we are making. Its a vortex like motion, panned outwards. The artist at Blizzard have made and applied normal and albedo textures to give it a dark, tar-like appearance. Looks amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;baldurs-gate-3&#34;&gt;Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another title I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed with &lt;em&gt;(many of you most likely are as well)&lt;/em&gt; is Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; controls title=&#34;Video cut showing from Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Shows a party of adventurers with a bright visual effect under them. They are in the dark interior of the Moonrise Towers zone.&#34;&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Another video embed above. Shows four adventurers inside the dark interiors of Moonrise Towers zone. Under their feet is an animated aura VFX. It looks like a bright, chroma and rainbow vortex.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;!-- this is alt text --&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look under the feet of my Tiefling Sorcerer in the video above, on the dark floor tiles of Moonrise Towers you will see a bright, white vortex with outwards movement. From time to time it gets a chromatic tint that gives it a subtle rainbow look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This again is exactly the polar coordinates UV distortion we are making. The difference between this one and ours &lt;em&gt;(and the one in Diablo 4)&lt;/em&gt; is that here, the devs at Larian Studios have also put a low opacity mask. That gives the effect a more transparent look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets first see the entire material graph:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &amp;ldquo;Material Domain&amp;rdquo; we use &amp;ldquo;Surface. In the &amp;ldquo;Blend Mode&amp;rdquo; we go &amp;ldquo;Opaque&amp;rdquo;. For &amp;ldquo;Shading Model&amp;rdquo; we use &amp;ldquo;Unlit&amp;rdquo;. Two Sided is ticked off, Use Material Attributes is off as well. &amp;ldquo;Cast Ray Traced Shadows&amp;rdquo; is on and for Subsurface Profile there is nothing. The Advanced settings are left to their default states.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you only want to get the visual result and are not interested in any technical, mathematical or further detailed explanation behind some of the steps and nodes, you can replicate what you see from the zoomed up pictures above and skip most of the tutorial below.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets start from the beginning though:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-the-polar-coordinates&#34;&gt;Creating the Polar Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a &amp;ldquo;Materials&amp;rdquo; folder in your project directory. Inside create a &amp;ldquo;Parents&amp;rdquo; folder. In there we will create our parent materials from which we will create our instanced materials later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click in there and make a new material. Name it &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;MAT_Parent_VFX_Vortex&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Open it. Click the output node and lets tweak the settings, putting them to what we mentioned tiny bit ago:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos105.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right click anywhere. In the search box that appears write &amp;ldquo;tex&amp;rdquo; and once &amp;ldquo;TextureCoordinates&amp;rdquo; appears, click on it to add it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos106.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold &amp;ldquo;S&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard. Press once on the board, under the newly added TexCoord node. A new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo; will appear. It will have its name set as &amp;ldquo;Param&amp;rdquo;. Edit it and name it &amp;ldquo;Polar Centre&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;component-mask&#34;&gt;Component Mask&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the search we explained, find and add &amp;ldquo;Subtract&amp;rdquo; node. Connect it like what is seen below. Then search &amp;ldquo;ComponentMask&amp;rdquo; and add two of them. We will order and tweak them in the next step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos108.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;176&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;422px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;ldquo;ComponentMask&amp;rdquo; node. By default &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; channels are on. For node that is on the top row, leave only &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; on. For the node that is at the bottom, leave &amp;ldquo;G&amp;rdquo; on. Then search for a &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Add it like seen below (which is both A and B connected to the Subtract).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;arctangent2&#34;&gt;Arctangent2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;Arctangent2&amp;rdquo; and add one. Connect the two masks into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock info&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Arc tangent is an inverse tangent function. We do an inverse tangent function because we are switching from Cartesian coordinates and moving into Polar coordinates. We are doing Arctangent2 instead of Arctangent because we are dealing with a coordinates system split into four quadrants. Arctangent would limit us only into quadrant number one and four. By the end of this tutorial I&amp;#39;ve linked further reading on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(If you would like a bit more optimized result, you can replace your Arctangent2 for Arctangent2Fast. It is a node a bit less accurate, but still accurate enough for our visuals to remain the same.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pi&#34;&gt;Pi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a &amp;ldquo;Component Mask&amp;rdquo; again, this time change its settings so only &amp;ldquo;R&amp;rdquo; channel is on. After it add a &amp;ldquo;Divide&amp;rdquo; node and connect the Mask into A. Then search for &amp;ldquo;math pi&amp;rdquo; and select Pi to add on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-007-tut03/amarantos111.jpg&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Add a Scalar Parameter with a value of 2 and connect it into Multiplier (S) input of the Pi node. Connect the Pi output into the B input of Divide node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock normal&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you are recreating this in Unity in Shader Graph or in Amplify Shader Editor. Because you totally could, all nodes and functions exist over there, no matter it is another engine. If for some reason Pi is not defined in whatever package you have, you could just add a new scalar parameter and give it a value of == 6.2831 which would be correct enough approximation of 2 x Pi for the shader to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;frac&#34;&gt;Frac&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &amp;ldquo;Divide&amp;rdquo; node, add a &amp;ldquo;Frac&amp;rdquo; node. Now take a look at the lower row, right after the &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; node. Create a Mask (R) and Mask (G) nodes. Connect both of them into an &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search for &amp;ldquo;SquareRoot&amp;rdquo;. Add it into the board (it will show up as &amp;ldquo;Sqrt&amp;rdquo;). Now put two &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; nodes at each row and connect into &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tip for a tidy board:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can select all of the nodes and press &amp;ldquo;C&amp;rdquo; on the keyboard (C stands for Comment in this case). That will add a big frame over it all. For text put in &amp;ldquo;Polar Coordinates&amp;rdquo;. Change the color to blue or whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on the right side of the previous work, right after the &amp;ldquo;Append&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search &amp;ldquo;Texture Sample&amp;rdquo;. Add one and connect &amp;ldquo;Append&amp;rdquo; into its &amp;ldquo;UVs&amp;rdquo; pin. With the &amp;ldquo;Texture Sample&amp;rdquo; selected, rename it to &amp;ldquo;AlbedoTexture&amp;rdquo;. In its settings change the following: MipValueMode: MipLevel (absolute, 0 is full resolution). Sampler Type: Linear Color. (these are pointed in the image below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;color-control&#34;&gt;Color Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets create the final part of the shader. It will be a bunch of new nodes that we will then frame into a red comment box, as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by adding a &amp;ldquo;Vector Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to a new Multiply. Then add a new &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Tint Power&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to the Multiply as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add another &amp;ldquo;Scalar Parameter&amp;rdquo;. Name it &amp;ldquo;Brightness&amp;rdquo;. Connect it to the &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; of a new Multiply node. In the A connect the AlbedoTexture node from the previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a final &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;. In the A input of it, add the previous &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;. In the B, add the &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo; that comes right after the &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; color node (vector parameter). The result of this final &amp;ldquo;Multiply&amp;rdquo;, connect into the &amp;ldquo;Emissive Color&amp;rdquo; of the final Material Input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(When you are done with all of the above you can select it all and add yourself a red comment frame, like seen below. Name it &amp;ldquo;Color Control&amp;rdquo;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go back to your Project Directory. Find where this material parent that we just made is. Right click on it and select &amp;ldquo;Create Material Instance&amp;rdquo;. Call it &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Open it. All of the Scalar Parameters and Vector Parameters (color) have default values but we now want to connect our texture in there and also change the values so we get the visual we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parameters&#34;&gt;Parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After opening the newly created material instance, use the parameter values as seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preview-in-action&#34;&gt;Preview in Action&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drag into a scene the imported vortex geometry you created in part one of the tutorial. Then change its scale to 1.5 1.5 1.3 &lt;em&gt;(this is optional, I just scaled mine a bit so its not too small when compared to a 2m tall human mannequin)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats! This is it. You should be able to see the movement and animation in the VFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;troubleshooting&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dragged your material shader onto the geometry and your object suddenly turned pitch black, then lets fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This most commonly happens on older versions of UE.5. Its due to the material graph parent shader not being suitable for &amp;ldquo;Nanite Geometry&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove the imported static geometry vortex basin from the project directory (content browser). Now re-import it but this time around from the Import settings tick &amp;ldquo;Nanite&amp;rdquo; off. Now retry dragging it into the scene and applying the material and it should work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class =&#34;colorblock error&#34;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Important:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you look at the VFX result from a camera angle from above, you will see UV distortion imperfection. We resolve that in the next part of the tutorial. Even if you don&amp;#39;t want to create a refraction shader, and would like to skip that, make sure to still visit the next tutorial and find the solution to this UV distortion issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;where we can see the solution to fixing the UV distortion in the middle.&lt;/a&gt; Scroll down to the &amp;ldquo;Troubleshooting&amp;rdquo; chapter in there to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;color&#34;&gt;Color&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We keep it to white here because in the final part of the tutorial series, we will create a Blueprint in which we control the color tint. That part is optional. As such if you prefer to skip it, and instead want the colors right away, as seen in the tutorial previews (blue, purple, green), then do the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create 3 copies of the above material instance. That is the one we just made and called &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_A”. Those copies rename &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Blue”, &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Purple” and &amp;ldquo;MAT_VFX_Vortex_Green”. Go in each and change the &amp;ldquo;Base Tint&amp;rdquo; HEX linear value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue: 1A5CF700&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purple: 941AF700&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green: 1AF78100&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial we created the main driving force of the VFX: the polar coordinates shader. We then created material instances of it and went over what settings to use in order to get the visual we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next part of the series, we will quickly create a &amp;ldquo;Refraction&amp;rdquo; material shader. We will use that as a floating layer of detail, above the vortex we have now. This step will be incredibly short and easy to make in comparison to the length and difficulty of the previous 3 parts of this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next part in the tutorial - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-008-tut04/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

&lt;p&gt;Over the last nine months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly developing my latest environment scene. It&amp;rsquo;s process documented both in writing and in work-in-progress images has been scattered across my social channels. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of positive comments and encouragement a long the way by some wonderful people. Some of you, dear readers, might have even seen the project and the aforementioned images already. I wanted to still pull it all together, so to speak, into one condensed place. Tie up the scattered posts and ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that tie up, I hope for some of you to find inspiration. Others I hope find insight and resources towards what and how I set to accomplish the things I have in my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos001.jpg&#34;

It grows in an overpowering reds, oranges and yellows. It&amp;rsquo;s emission is picked up in real time through Lumen and casts light on the floating primitives next to it.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above is the first screenshot I took inside the environment scene. An orange, abstract, floating, orb. This had been an experiment of importing an animated orb directly from Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-beginning&#34;&gt;Project Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2022 I was experimenting with a small game prototype I had started in Unreal Engine 4. It was a topdown camera RPG with lots of spells and action. I never got to the part of prototyping much of this &amp;ldquo;action&amp;rdquo; but I did blueprint a lot of the initial movement, camera work, and then also had started on a few spells and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t exactly be going into details about the prototype itself as that would call for another long post of its own, and would branch us away from the topic of this current scene. The context important to the start of this environment is that in early July 2022, after creating the initial Blueprints foundation for a few abilities inside the game, I set off to learn and experiment with Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos002.jpg&#34;

In the middle of a screen is the player character. Up and right from her is a well prop with a mysterious red glow.&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;397px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thought process behind getting into Houdini was that I wanted to create some spells VFX and animations. But the idea I had in mind was for fluidity and smooth movement, one that would be accomplished through fluid simulations. Yet for obvious performance and scaling reasons I could not get into creating actual real time fluid simulations (not that I have the knowledge to do that even if there is a way to scale it performance wise [I bet there is, smart people out there certainly have accomplished it]).&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These orbs above are my initial Houdini experiments, as seen imported inside my UE4 game prototype. They have a looping animation attached to them. You can see preview of it further down in this post in some of the YouTube embeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vertex-animation-textures&#34;&gt;Vertex Animation Textures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years prior I had heard a lot about the technique of baking down animations in vertex look-up tables. Those end up in the form of a bitmap that then is read from a shader in order to tell each triangle of the mesh how and where to move to. Interpolate between those different key &amp;ldquo;positions&amp;rdquo; on the texture and you get an animation (this is an incredibly oversimplified explanation, apologies to anyone that might be reading it and happen to be the type of Tech Artist to implement these amazing things from the absolute scratch!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of technique is called Vertex Animation Textures &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vertex-animation-textures-for-unreal/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;(VAT)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animations in the form of VAT have one incredible advantage over other type of game animations: it&amp;rsquo;s entirely driven in a shader. Onto the GPU. We don&amp;rsquo;t use or deploy any types of bones or skeletons and as such any object you animate in this way can end up as a Static Mesh. The animation, as I mentioned, then happens on the GPU through the reading of the vertex look-up table texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is memory footprint, of course. It comes in the form of the quite oversized in width and height look-up textures (which makes them have large file sizes). Also for a smooth and interesting &amp;ldquo;fluid&amp;rdquo; like animation, your Static Mesh might end up being quite rich on polycount too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vat-demonstration&#34;&gt;VAT Demonstration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first picture you can see a fuzzy ball mesh I created parametrically in Houdini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos004.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1918&#34;
	height=&#34;1130&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Houdini screenshot. UI of the software is seen and in the left viewport one can inspect the fuzzy orb mesh.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;169&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;407px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then imported that mesh inside Unreal 4. I didn&amp;rsquo;t export it from Houdini as an ordinary static geometry. Instead I exported it as a VAT and in Unreal used a SideFX plugin and shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos005.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1420&#34;
	height=&#34;980&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Unreal 4 screenshot. Viewport look of the fuzzy orb mesh. It looks whole, top side reads &amp;ldquo;24,898 triangles&amp;rdquo;.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;144&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;347px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that orb, seen appearing like a proper mesh, is after the SideFX shader for reading VATs has been applied. If we ignore that shader and take a look at the geometry that the VAT exports, without material graph or the vertex look-up table textures that are generated, this is how it looks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/amarantos-001/amarantos006.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1420&#34;
	height=&#34;977&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Another Unreal 4 screenshot. The same orb mesh seen above looked at again. Now the shader is not used and as such we see it as a giant, 3D matrix collection of triangles scattered in space.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;145&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;348px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned already, image above is orb imported in Unreal but no VAT textures are applied yet. As such its a collection of what to us appears like arbitrary placed triangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;useful-vats&#34;&gt;Useful VATs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why use VATs in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we try to animate, say hundreds or thousands of actors onto the scene, all visible, even if they are incredibly low-poly, and use no complex textures to drag down our texture streaming budget, we often will still hit performance issues and hardly have any low MS (high FPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for that is because when we display on the screen actors like that, ones with skeleton rig animations, they each end up being a separate draw call. Those draw calls go through the CPU and as such we end up being bound on CPU before we even get to use much of the potential that our GPU has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such the VAT is a trade-off where we might increase slightly the polycount, increase the use of textures budged, but end up with incredibly optimized amount of draw calls. The orbs you see above, I could render 100-200 of them in the scene, visible from one camera angle at all time, and still have low MS and good performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;animation&#34;&gt;Animation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, there is also the more obvious part. It&amp;rsquo;s the content of the animations. In Houdini I wanted to make some fluids like sims that I could perhaps pull of through a shader in Unreal entirely. It would require of me to offset my orb surfaces with World Position Offset to give it a fuzzy, liquid like movement on its surface. But then if I wanted the visual to look proper and as cool as the ones in the VATs it would mean I need to recalculate my normals as well so light bounces off those WPO surface movements correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I will give a go at recalculating normals and making a shader like that at some point in Unreal. But for now I wanted to use the opportunity to learn fluid sims in Houdini and then learn VATs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing an orb with fluid like movement animation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The animation, seen after VAT import in Unreal. In this video below, the VAT shader is from SideFX but I have added control over Albedo, and Emission and I&amp;rsquo;ve plugged in a Fresnel function. It gives it the glowing effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Youtube embedded video above, showcasing the VAT orbs but in UE5. These are now shaded and have more refined visuals.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I found all of the above incredibly interesting and fascinating, even before I dived to learn the nitty-gritty of it all. I am not really a VFX artist or an animator. But I do have a love for Tech Art (even if I&amp;rsquo;m not a Tech Art in my fulltime studio job either!). My setting off into making these type of fluid like animations for my spells came in big chunk through the motivation of me wanting to see if I have in me what it takes to learn and deploy these techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out I did. To no one surprise because as we usually do when it comes to most tooling and software in the games industry, we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and concepted, created then implemented the techniques. A chorus of ingenious people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m saying this because after all of the descriptions above that might sound incredibly complicated to those of you who have not yet experimented or learnt this type of stuff, you might be left with the misconception that this is incredibly hard to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s indeed not as complicated as it sounds. The biggest challenge I faced in learning Houdini was how to actually come up with my initial orb animation. When I did that, the moment I wanted to turn the anim timeline into a VAT and import it into Unreal, I had a bunch of tools already created for us by SideFX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to implement or write any shader. I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to automate any export - import. Those were all already available in Houdini (better yet, they come out of the box with exporters for UE4, UE5 and Unity alike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this and hoping of trying these type of techniques, either follow the page I linked above (&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/vertex-animation-textures-for-unreal/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;SideFX - VAT for Unreal&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or follow these videos, which I followed - &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cPRYwF-Tvg&amp;amp;list=PLoltx0CAXYf75OzQ3H_eGboHlrrf44gsi&amp;amp;index=1&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VAT 4 | RBD | Unreal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaKNjIC66_8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;VAT 5 | Fluids | Unreal&lt;/a&gt; - though I believe those two are just mirrors of the VAT link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before getting into them I suggest watching some general videos of how to manipulate and animate geometry to look like its surface is changing, or even doing some fluid simulation tutorials. After all before you try to turn something into a VAT you want to make sure you have a Houdini animation ready in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create my orbs I experimented and at the end came up with a pipeline that creates geometrical primitives &amp;ndash; feeds them into Clouds &amp;ndash; feeds into VDB &amp;ndash; then VDB to Polygons. That with recalculated, smoothed normals produces results similar to the Houdini video I embedded under the &lt;strong&gt;6. Animation&lt;/strong&gt; section of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to find out how to merge different orbs into an abstract structure, I recommend giving this video a go: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hkcRgCgzo&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47hkcRgCgzo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually the one I started with. Later on, once I realized I want to try VATs, I winged it and added the &amp;ldquo;convert to clouds then convert to VDB then back to polygons&amp;rdquo; part I described above. I did that because I found that was the easiest way for me to add motion to the otherwise static orbs produced in the tutorial in the sentence above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environment-scene&#34;&gt;Environment Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had made some floating orbs and they were animating nicely inside my UE4 game prototype, of course my Environment Artist side kicked in&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think how even though I love using this inside the game prototype, it would be very fun to try and use it inside a polished, set dressed scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I briefly considered just creating a large, circular room inside my game itself. Then set dressing it and polishing it to a vertical slice. As if when you walk inside it you walk into a finished game environment. It wont matter if the entrance or the parts before that were placeholder and checker board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s around the time I got this story unfolding in my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the chamber shifted around them, their worship remained unmoving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circular, repetitive room. Just a few modular pieces.
In the middle there is a shape that changes like fluid, using Houdini and VAT.
It has strong emission and perhaps could light the room entirely thanks to that and Lumen? Test it in UE5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape will pulse and be animated thanks to the VAT and combination of Niagara curves and wave functions.
Next to it will be in circle a number of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are on their knees like in a ritual worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They move up and down their upper torso, while remaining in position, waving hands in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point the shape &amp;ldquo;glitches&amp;rdquo; into a bunch of triangles (try using a wrong Look Up Table / Textures for the VAT?).
As that happens, one of the people is lifted in the air, rotated 180 degrees and then slowly floated into the shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shape consumes them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cite&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;― &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;6 July 2022&lt;/span&gt;&lt;cite&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got that story and jotted down those ideas above on paper, I knew I have to open a new scene and focus entire on that. I put my UE4 game prototype on the side shelf. I opened a new UE5 scene and started blocking out the space. The VAT Houdini orb I made would be the center piece. The jewel in the middle that I spent so much time on and learned so much through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-scene-shot&#34;&gt;Early Scene Shot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of the above analyzed and described, we can now dive right into the environment side of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some hours of blocking out and making some initial building wall pieces in Blender, here is what I took the scene to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post in this series we will take a look at my initial reference board. We will also see the different modular pieces I made in Blender and how I went about moving them into Zbrush and sculpting having in mind my end result will be used as Nanite meshes.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/orbital008.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Orbital Gateway - 08 - Platforms, Background, Optimisation" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. Quick update with a few things in my scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/orbital008.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1080&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Main angle camera screenshot from Unreal 4. Progress from last post showcases lots of splashes of gold and yellow on the surfaces of the portal cylinder and its greebles. There is also some of that, together with sci-fi, square grid wall textures, in the background.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visually, I spent my attention on mainly two things. First was working on the platforms that the humans sit on. I created a proper mesh to replace the previous placeholder. I also made a material with gradient I can tweak and put colors and noises on top of in order to get that force field effect. I experimented with a few colors for it but ultimately ended up with the one like in the original concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00183.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1098&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Close up screenshot of the floating platform. Its top and bottom are Zbrush sculpts showing metal with intricate carvings. In the middle of the platform stand 3 UE mannequins in an A pose. Around them is a strong, yellow emissive ring.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then moved onto the background once again. I tried to improve the protrusion bits I had placed previously. I wanted the hard surface to look proper and as if part of the room and like weld metal, as opposed to the previous golden supports that looked just like clipped through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-Screenshot00184.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1920&#34;
	height=&#34;1098&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot of the sides of the giant room, around the portal cylinder. The walls have square, greeble like flat texture with strong normals giving it dimension. Also occasional yellow lights scattered here and there. In the middle of the picture is a cylindrical opening and platform. That is where spaceships would float through, going towards the portal.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;419px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also worked more on my trimsheet that I deploy in the background. I added a part to it that has panel-like details and greeble like features. You can see that above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimization&#34;&gt;Optimization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all of this takes us to today. Tonight I decided to try optimizing the scene a bit. I had spline meshes, non-static parts and materials in the scene that I wanted to improve tech wise. It would not be a successful video at the end, if I were to leave the performance as it were and recorded at 15 FPS. : )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before. Constant at 75-80 ms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/Screenshot_2021-02-04_181630.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1297&#34;
	height=&#34;739&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;SCENE RENDERING screen shown in Unreal 4 Editor. Lists and details RenderViewFamily, Draw calls, and other profiling stats. Most important one here, for this case study, is the stat third from bottom to top: Mesh draw calls. In this picture it reads 1,696.45.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;175&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;421px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After. Stable at around 18 ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/Screenshot_2021-02-04_184841.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1298&#34;
	height=&#34;744&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screen identical to the previous. Important stat is again: Mesh draw calls. In this &amp;ldquo;after&amp;rdquo; picture it reads 306.00.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;174&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;418px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With some more clean-up and with no &lt;em&gt;stat scenerendering&lt;/em&gt; on, I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at a stable 10 ms. Quite better even than the previously mentioned 18 ms. This is not in standalone form so one could argue it might be even better there. I think for recording the video I&amp;rsquo;ll play a timeline through a cooked standalone project and maybe get a bit of a boost in ms from that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ms-comparison&#34;&gt;MS Comparison&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all I think it will do for now. Here is one final comparison to an ms observation from a week ago to show you how slow it was, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/pd-opt-comp.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;993&#34;
	height=&#34;501&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Two screenshots from the Unreal Editor. Left shows &amp;ldquo;stat unit&amp;rdquo; at 60.6 FPS, 164.97 ms (with hit mostly on GPU). Right image shows the same, but after fixes up. Reads 94.33 FPS, 10.60 ms.&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;198&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;475px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gif-progress&#34;&gt;Gif Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But away from this, and back to visuals. Here is a GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-008/peter-dimitrov-progress-gif-space-007.gif&#34;

	height=&#34;548&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Gif progress from the usual camera angle. This time it mostly showcases progress on the background and the walls. First they had placeholder, gray materials, but then were replaced for greeble texture details.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you are doing well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/orbital-gateway-009/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;Go to next blog entry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly mention how exactly I accomplished the big win in performance above. I think anyone with experience can derive and make an educated guess, just by looking at my stat scenerendering profiling pictures above. Yet I write and share these posts with a lot of students too and I wanted to explain it a bit better for them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the making of this project, I heavily relied on spline blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When there is a long platform, be it straight geometry or cylindrical motives, instead of placing by hand a repetitive, modular piece, I would feed that piece into a spline blueprint system of my own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It made the art creation process much more quick and powerful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is one caveat though. When you work with spline blueprints like that you end up leaving all parts as &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be able to edit a spline curve on the go too, the nodes derive tangent points.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of those pieces stack up in draw calls. When you place one long platform that is a spline blueprint, instead of having say 1 to 5 draw calls you end up with 150-200, because of all of the spline components.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you put an identical platform spline blueprint copy next to it, that gets its own 150-200 draw calls too. They don&amp;rsquo;t get bundle together with the first one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew this from the very get go, when I started adding splines. I knew I will need to go back and clean up and &amp;ldquo;bake&amp;rdquo; my geometry into truly static geometry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Before&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;After&amp;rdquo; screenshots above, you see me doing exactly that. I select my spline blueprints and I use the Unreal 4 Editor integrated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/Basics/Actors/Merging/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Merge Actors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That turns my one, super long platform (for example) that has 150 draw calls into one piece of geometry, that is say mid-poly, but is 1 draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I then reuse that super long platform, to the sides, by replacing the rest of the similar blueprints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t change the x y z scale of those copied platforms (otherwise the draw calls get separated again, even if not as bad as before).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doing even more actions, similar to the above description, I optimized the draw calls in my scene from 1,696.45 to 306.00.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That on its own got me from 77 ms (12 fps) to a 10 ms (94 fps).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unrelated to the Blueprints or Splines above, but if you are using the Unreal Geometry Brushes to block out spaces, bear in mind they have similar caveat of draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each of those brushes, in its nature to be editable on the go, comes with dozens of draw calls instead of optimized just a few calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I often come across student&amp;rsquo;s block out projects that run at bare minimum FPS. They often ask and wonder why that happens and most often my advise is either to bake down all of their Geometry Brushes to truly static, non editable geometry, or to start blocking out using primitive Static Meshes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have fun in Unreal!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs</title>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/cover007.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Neon Graveyard - 07 - Neon Signs" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;After finishing the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;
    &gt;casket&lt;/a&gt; prop, I&amp;rsquo;ve had time to go back to the overall scene and continue working on missing props and details for the landscape. The other thing is refining textures and figuring out how exactly I&amp;rsquo;m going to tackle making the neon signs. Previously, my neons were just simple alpha cards with an emissive text. Although in its core that&amp;rsquo;s what neon signs look like anyway, I wanted to put more attention and detail into them than just that. Possibly build a more complex material shader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the last two posts were about the casket, it&amp;rsquo;s been a very long while since we&amp;rsquo;ve last seen the scene as a whole. As such I am just going to show you at what stage I am right now, and then we can talk about how I created the different bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scene&#34;&gt;The Scene&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/cover007.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;A look at the scene from the main camera angle. There are more neon signs on the mausoleums and the cathedral. They also now illuminate in electric colors the surroundings, as opposed to before when they were casting no lights.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as a reminder - this was we had before (three weeks ago or so):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/04_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;neon-signs&#34;&gt;Neon Signs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From close up, this is how the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; sign looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov11.jpg&#34;

		alt=&#34;Close up on one of the mausoleums entrances. A neon sign with the text &amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo; is attached. It  glows in blue and purple neon colors. Tubing of illuminated neon wrap around the sign metal mounts.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a few GIFs to show the animations I&amp;rsquo;ve put in the signs. (gifs are heavily compressed as Artstation caps the file size at a very low amount).&lt;/p&gt;

A floppy disk neon switches on and off between two states, giving it a moving animation.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;176&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;424px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to make some even more dynamic, by having letters flick. The metal mounts of each sign still lack textures, but that will be for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov12.jpg&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The text that&amp;rsquo;s lit up is in Russian and reads the same way as the English one next to it &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a play on words as well, which I will animate for the final video. The idea I have in mind with that is about the text in Russian, appearing lit up fully at first - &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Сохраняйте свое сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The whole sign then flicks on and off a few times, as if short on electricity. When it powers up again, its left with just &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;охраняй сознание&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. First and last two letters from the first word are off, second word is entirely off. And what we are left with reads from &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Backup your&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Guard your Consciousness&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, I made the alpha cards of the neons into 3D objects. I made a few of the texts into actual geometry, but then when I inserted them in, you couldn&amp;rsquo;t really tell from afar that they are dimensional and 3D. Going up close to them, most still looked relatively the same - flat. That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided that there is no really point into turning them into expensive on memory 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain text with an emissive material was flat as well, and as such I went into trying to figure out another way to make them look better, more dimensional, and more neon-ish. That&amp;rsquo;s when I though of trying a transparent text with a border. I then put a second border to that said border. The inner border, I assigned bright color together with emission. The outer border, I left dark. The fact that they are transparent from the inside, boosted the illusion of &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;neon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. What I discovered then, is a trick I made up which turned them actually dimensional &lt;em&gt;(sadly probably not very well seen in the GIFs due the small image size)&lt;/em&gt;. I duplicated the text as it is in the world in the engine. I then offset its position by a few pixels backwards from the original position. To that second copy, I then applied an instance of the original material. In that instance, I can change the previously exposed parameters such as the colors of the inner and outer borders, as well as emission level of the glow. Then, by changing those colors, to ones completely different from the original, I managed to create an illusion of depth. The result is best seen when you move the camera while looking at the signs from a side. The secondary colors, from the text copy that is behind, leak and bloom softly. They contrast so well with the front text, that whilst you move, they make the whole text appear as if an actual neon, with dimension and shifts in the value and hue of its color. That effect is apparent even from the static shot seen above, that showcases the &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; neon.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borders, I created in Photoshop using Blending Options - Stroke. To keep everything optimised, I suggest making those masks into a single image. In the image above, I&amp;rsquo;ve put the two different borders, onto two channels - one on Green, the other on Blue. In the material shader, I simply take those channels and assign them color and emission value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve showed you how I do this with a single text - &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Eternity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; taking a whole bitmap of 512x512, but for this project, I actually keep every text and neon design, into one single image. In a 2k texture, you can fit much more than you would think, and using every channel - R, G and B - allows for even more effects and optimisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;headstones-and-other-props&#34;&gt;Headstones and Other Props&lt;/h2&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zbrush, I imported low-poly models of headstones that I created in Maya. I turn them high-poly by dividing the geometry with smooth off. I then sculpt detail on that and when I am happy with the result, I create a new, low-poly version, by decimating the topology. For that, I use Decimation Master, that can be found in Zbrush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/neon-graveyard-007/other_shot_neon_peter_dimitrov14.jpg&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headstone seen below, I decimated from 2.3m tris to 2k using Decimation Master. When you go to poly that low, you can freely take the model in Maya, and UV map it by hand. 2k tris is not too much, and as such the automatic mapping in the newer versions of Maya does quite a good job. It takes most of the flat surfaces and gives you whole UV islands, and it leaves just a few weird triangles here and there, that you can quickly sew back in place. Small edges with lots of damage on them, usually get mapped weirdly too, but you can go over those and fix them with relative ease.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;170&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;409px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of giving the weird letters on the headstones, actual metal mounts and have some cables run towards them from the ground. Right now they sort of give the vibe of magical runes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-things&#34;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the landscape I&amp;rsquo;ve scattered some detail using small rocks, broken pavement as well as some cables. I&amp;rsquo;ve created the cables as a spline system, and although it took a bit of time to place as many copies as I&amp;rsquo;ve done, it was very fun to do. Obviously, I tried having them glowing at first, but decided against it as it was getting a bit too much in the way. Their texture might still need some more work though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cathedral in the distance will still need some more attention. I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of some decals and props to scatter and give variety and detail both to the roof and to the walls. The windows will have stained glass material to them, with an emissive mask. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to achieve some electrical whimsical colors, to fit the Cyberpunk vibe. I&amp;rsquo;ve left them for this late on, as I already have plans on how to create them in Substance Designer. Working on materials like that is probably one of the things I enjoy most in 3D, and frankly said, that&amp;rsquo;s why I am keeping them as a treat to myself after I get the rest of the important things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you found this post insightful and interesting. Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last post we mentioned the most important Blueprints we need in order to have actual gameplay. They do build the win/lose condition, but we still need one more very important element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need what I call right now, and am going to refer to, with the word “blocks”. The blocks are the pieces that go on the environment to cast shadows here and there. The blocks are what the player is in control of, as I said way back in the first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tetris-pieces&#34;&gt;Tetris Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the game, I have tiles, that put together create the map/surface area. Then, on top of those, go the blocks. They fit together perfectly in slots, as I need it to be visually explicit where a player is allowed to place and where they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;557px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First “sketch” of the shapes I did in Maya. It was a quick test to see what shape could work the best. At that point in my mind I already knew I wanted one shape repeated many times like a tile, but I still was not certain what that shape would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;142&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;342px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I did anything, I had a quick sketch, that does not look very impressive, that I made in Photoshop. It was more of a guide for the mood, that was assuring me I am going in the direction I want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could probably see that the image I produced above, was what inspired me to go towards a blue starry sky, overall dark tone, and a very bright sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also sort of see the path, illustrated in blue, and the idea of going from point A to point B as a main objective in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sun&#34;&gt;Sun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I had figured out the visual of the tiles, and the Sun next to them, the first draft was a hollow, holographic looking star. Although I said I don’t have plenty of time to create textures and shaders (thus the tiles are textureless) I still needed to make sure the Sun has a texture. The Sun needs one, because it is a main game mechanic element. We need to be able to tell, visually, that it’s big, that it’s hot, and that it is potentially dangerous. It can’t simply be hollow. That is when I went into making a texture and some basic animation for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final visuals of the sun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sun is created from two spheres that go inside each one. The outer one is a low poly, with a Fresnel Shader applied to it. It gives it the triangular holographic look, that flickers with a subtle animation. Inside of it is a proper texture, unlit Shader, that has an animated normal and some glow too. Both materials can be controlled for a change in color.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Screenshot similar to the previous one. Three spheres but now each has different color. First one is green, second is a discordant combination of purple and blue and third one is overpowering yellow with splash of tiny oranges. &#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Different colors of the stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some levels of the game could have multiple suns different locations. In that case I can have selection of colors so each is unique, more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-block-pieces&#34;&gt;Back to the Block Pieces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What those needed was a “placement system” Blueprint. It was good that I knew exactly how I wanted that. That’s, again, thanks to the traditional RTS games. What I ended up making is simple in words, but more complex in Blueprints. It’s a system where you can click on a block to place it, it becomes semi-transparent and red (again with the help of a Fresnel function). If you point to a tile, that is marked with a Boolean that says “True” for “Is this tile Place-able on?”, then the transparent color turns green. It also lets you place it on top if you click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system for that is quite complex and I genuinely would have to do a few posts to find a way to explain it like a tutorial. Something, for which sadly there is no time right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also have to thank my brother, Miroslav Dimitrov, who is a programmer and helped me figure out the logic of a few things I needed to do, so I could properly turn them into Blueprints. I am sure he did not find it as amusing and fun as I did, mainly because he writes in code, has no idea how Blueprints work, and had to just guide me and watch me struggle on my own with Unreal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guide for anyone that might want to make a system like that is to look into &lt;strong&gt;Get Hit Result Under Cursor by Channel&lt;/strong&gt;. That is basically a line trace that goes where the location of the mouse cursor is. After you use that, do a check to what object the mouse is pointing at, and then have your IFs to change color, check if placement is possible and et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/chromosphere003/chromosphere_pd_027.jpg&#34;
	width=&#34;1280&#34;
	height=&#34;711&#34;
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot from the game showing the tiles and a sun next to them. The mouse cursor is hovered over a specific tile that has a triangular gap inside. With the mouse being there, a holographic, green, obstacle tile shows on top. It&amp;rsquo;s an indication that the tile is a valid placement. (like in an RTS)&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;180&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;432px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pointing the mouse at valid slot tiles makes the block green. Red for not being able to place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blocks-visuals&#34;&gt;Blocks Visuals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I want to mention, that given the blocks are so important and the player interacts with them, it would make sense to have textures and proper interesting models for them. I would love to do that, but for now just a different color will have to do. I will go back to it and maybe model out something, given that after I completed all of the important Blueprints I need, and I make a few playable levels, I am left with some free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research on how the blocks could potentially look just randomly walked through my door one day. Or more like not my door, but the door of the university building I am in during classes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beautiful statues, courtesy of &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/cherylvollorceramics/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those intricate ceramic statues, painted with acrylic on top (if I remember correctly) are created by &lt;em&gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/em&gt;. I met her randomly in the first showcase room here at UCLAN in Preston. To get to the studio of our class, you walk through an entrance, small “hall” of sorts, where every week different art displays are put on. That’s where Cheryl had the exhibit of her statues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment I first saw them, I suddenly imagined some of the maps of my game to be like that. A weird, alien environment, with peculiar crystal formations and colorful blocks that are in a juxtaposition with the dull monotone colors of the surface. The player could pick up those blocks and move them around. This whole thought came to me way before I had done any prototyping and it just sparkled a lot of excitement in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Cheryl, who was amazing, and let me use the visuals of her statues in any game I created or for any research I would need. Thanks again for that, Cheryl!&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;Another picture of ceramic sculptures. This time around not only is the ground in whites and blues/purples but the protruding parallelepipeds also have those colors. They are also angled in an uneasy fashion, as opposed to the first picture where they were nearly perfectly upright.&#34;

    &gt;Cheryl Vollor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I said, we will sadly have to wait to see if I get some free time to “upgrade” the visuals of my blocks with anything remotely similar to those pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you found this visual research intriguing. Next we will look into the first playtest with actual living people, that my game saw! Woah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-from-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update from 2023&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly update this entry to mention that there was no &amp;ldquo;next time&amp;rdquo;. I wrapped up the project by adding a few extra levels and having it all then playable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will admit to you though, that the game prototype was behind, priority wise, on the list of my other works, given I had at the time focused on crafting an Environment Art portfolio to try and find my break into the industry later that same 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such I put most of my attention in &amp;ldquo;The Animal Shrine&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;The Neon Graveyard&amp;rdquo; (both of which you can read in detail about by using the &amp;ldquo;Category&amp;rdquo; buttons to the right whilst on the main page of this blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did, however, create a &amp;ldquo;trailer&amp;rdquo; for the game, as part of the course. I never got to writing another entry to these blogs and showing it there, but here it is for you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;game-trailer&#34;&gt;Game Trailer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;video-wrapper&#34;&gt;

            title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;
    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No mention of &amp;ldquo;vampires in space&amp;rdquo;. Kind of a missed opportunity, 2019 Peter! Instead just &amp;ldquo;Astronauts&amp;rdquo;? Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see in the trailer that I tried to keep it humorous and easy going, as I thought then, and still believe that would be the right course of action for the game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finalized modelling and texturing 2 modular pieces and a prop. I also did some work on the landscape actor. The textures on the land are a placeholder and the colors maybe a bit too red, but I am really happy with how my Landscape Blending Material works. Created it in a such a way that its very easy to include a new texture and also parameters for roughness and tiling amount are exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the modular bits:&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;428px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go a bit heavier on geometry, because my main shots include those pieces repeated so much that they take quite a bit of screen space. Instead of tileable texture, I sculpted the two pieces, baked and then used my stone material I showed a few posts ago. Exposing HSV of it proved very useful as I was able to give it this green look that way. I might make the surface of the stones more light so they appear a bit more grey later on.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;A screen cap from the movie &amp;ldquo;10 Things I Hate About You&amp;rdquo;, turned into a meme that reads &amp;ldquo;I know you can model high poly and you can model low poly, but can you ever just model poly? - I think you can in Europe.&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve actually never seen the movie but came across the meme randomly.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meme to illustrate my thoughts (image not mine, its a meme after all). In an ideal world for an ideal game, I would have to do lots of optimizing with a few LODs for that modular prop. But as its not gonna get repeated that much and as we are dealing with specific angle shots, I can save time and not do it. That&amp;rsquo;s the main reason I decided to go with geometry instead of Substance Designer made texture, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like what you see, feel free to drop a comment. Good night from me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023-polycount&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023 (polycount)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back when I was making these stone, inclined beds above, I distinctively remember being incredibly worried that what I am creating is crazy amounts of high-poly. That whoever sees my work will see right past me and understand how inexperienced I am because of the high triangle count.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could have not been further from the truth (even with that second part above, about being inexperienced, being true back then).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t quote you exact numbers but if memory serves me well, the stones wall prop was sitting around 1,800 - 2,000 tris.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is absolutely acceptable. It is acceptable as a prop tris count now in 2023 and it was back in 2018 too. Not much has changed in the span of those years (well, if we ignore Nanite and the possibilities of UE5 right now, of course&amp;hellip;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the topic opens up a perfect opportunity to talk about triangle counts and preconceptions (and misconceptions) that fly around in students heads (like mine back then!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will try to keep it short and to the point, so my advise now would be: do not take polycount advise from people who don&amp;rsquo;t know what draw calls or LODs are. Do not take polycount advise from people who will not ask the questions of what the intended game style is and what the main gameplay camera implementation is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Truth is you can get away with really high poly budgets for a single object. You can do that because you can then implement a few LODs that load much smaller polycount copies with the player going further away from the object.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a lot of student projects not only are there no LODs in sight, especially in projects that are FPS and would benefit immensely from it, but in most of them the draw calls are an absolute mess as well.
As such the performance of their game prototype is dragged down by mostly that: over the roof high amount of draw calls and crazy amount of overlapping dynamic lights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next when inevitably the question pops up, in their prototype, of &amp;ldquo;What is wrong with the performance?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;How do we regain back good performance?&amp;rdquo; lots and lots of inexperienced tutors will take a look at the screen and in a deep, pondering facial expression go: &amp;ldquo;Hmmmm, yes&amp;hellip; your props are way too highpoly and the amount of tris drawn on the screen are too high.&amp;rdquo;. Wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analyze your draw calls first, look at your lights, consider some LODs and only then go cutting big percentages of polycount from objects that are most likely already lowpoly and optimized enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Unreal you can open the CMD (using the ¬ key on your keyboard) and type &amp;ldquo;stat scenerendering&amp;rdquo;. A menu will pop up that lists your amount of draw calls. Consider looking into ways to reduce them if they are high.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another very useful command is &amp;ldquo;ProfileGPU&amp;rdquo; that will open you up a much more detailed screen where you can see a breakdown of how much resources go where in ms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reading all of those is crucial for understanding better what the culprit of your performance is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to read more about draw calls (though not a technical guide by any means) you can do so over at &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/&#34;  title=&#34;index.md&#34;

        <title>The Animal Shrine - 06 - Lamps</title>

        <pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;img src="https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/cover006.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Animal Shrine - 06 - Lamps" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lights-in&#34;&gt;Lights In&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I modelled some hanging lanterns. I really needed to put some object that cast actual interesting light in my scene so I can start thinking about my light scenario. It&amp;rsquo;s still in the early stages and looks patchy in the sense of having a lot at of light at one place and then none at others, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be working on it more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://petedimitrovart.com/p/animal-shrine-006/cover006.jpg&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Screenshot of a camera between two buildings, close to them, Unreal 4. One can observer the wooden beams and supports, fully textured now. The roof has a wooden texture as well. There are hanging lantern props that cast some Point Lights too. In the distance, where the landscape ends, there are long, sharp cylinders that are indicating placeholder trees creating a forest.&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;177&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;426px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I sculpted a bit more the landscape around the place. I also scattered a lot of placeholders for the trees. It changed the mood of the whole place immediately in a way that I really like. I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look into how I&amp;rsquo;m going to make the trees and what to do with my mountains in the distance (they are just placeholder big boulders for now). I&amp;rsquo;m open to any suggestions and tips when it comes to creating the landscape guys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to the lanterns, they were kind of very fun to do. Their process was interesting to say the least. Right now they are an Actor (Blueprint) attached with a rope and a Physics Constraint. That way I can apply physics to them and use Impulse to add force and nudge them in one direction. Gives them a slight animation and it makes such a big difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While making them, I had to explore how the Physics Blueprints work in Unreal as I had never used them before. It produced an interesting result. Just when I thought that none of the Blueprints worked even the slightest, I looked up and saw a few lanterns suspended in the air, rotating around as if in zero G.&lt;/p&gt;

    &gt;
    &lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(YouTube video embedded above. Shows a hanging lantern that is suspended in open air and floats around as if the place has zero gravity.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have them working now, and its something that I believe will add quite a bit to my scene when it comes to the final rendering videos. Also now I know how to do stuff like that for any other object I might want to implement that could be moving. Only thing left now is to actually texture those lanterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to change the fog once again in order to make the &amp;ldquo;trees&amp;rdquo; in the distance appear lighter and thus look even further away. The fog changed how my roofs look though, made them maybe too light for my liking. The Volumetric Fog and Atmosphere actors are things I will have to tweak a lot more before I get to what I imagine, but at least there is progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be from me tonight guys, have a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;commentary-from-2023-draw-calls-tips&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Commentary from 2023 (draw calls tips)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wanted to quickly drop a few words about some of the things I showcase above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing what I know now, in 2023, compared to back in 2018, I would not approach making these lanterns with Physics Components at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is fun to experiment with Physics Components in Blueprints. If you have not had the chance to do so before, make sure to try as I think there is plenty to learn. There is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about back then though, and it&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental part of Tech Art and of creating optimized, real time scenes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Physics to work, we need to make the lanterns mesh &amp;ldquo;Movable&amp;rdquo; as opposed to &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo;. The moment we do that, we separate that piece of geometry in its own draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lets run a hypothetical situation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We leave the lantern static - like ordinary geometry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We scatter 10 copies of it near one another.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then we make sure the material used on all 10 copies is identical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the scaling options of each we leave it to 1;1;1 on the x;y;z scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great thing happens; the moment those 10 lanterns get to render on the screen they batch into a single draw call. This keeps it all more optimized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If we are in a blank scene and we render 10 lanterns in 1 draw call as opposed to 10 lanterns in 10 draw calls, we might not feel much of a difference, even if we inspect the fps / ms and profile the entire scene both GPU and CPU wise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Imagine increasing up the numbers and putting 100-200 even 1000 of these lanterns on the screen. Suddenly rendering all in 1 draw call as opposed to 1000 draw calls can be felt. Then add up all kinds of other art assets on the screen, some static, some movable. Add a bunch of fog cards and alpha card effects that are overdrawing the screen. Add lots of AI running on the CPU. Add some particles, doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you pick to scale them onto the CPU or the GPU. Suddenly you get the typical amount of things happening in a usual game world in a big AAA title.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Your performance will then be low, if you were to render these lanterns in 1000 draw calls instead of 1 draw call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lesson here being that we always need to consider clean practices of putting in art meshes so they end up as optimized and bundle in draw calls as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can hear you wondering, though, how are we to then make these lanterns move and look interesting? Without dirtying up our draw calls?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some might suggest doing a bespoke bone animation and then attaching it to the lantern. We animate it in Blender or Maya and import in Unreal. But that will have the same culprit of an issue as above. Animated assets with bones of their own most of the time end up as separate draw calls (there are ways to overcome that and still keep bone animations but that is for another blog).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As such a better way instead would be to ask the following. Is there a way I can bundle all of this movement onto the GPU? When you ask that question the follow up conclusion would be: yes! You can. Through a material shader perhaps? That&amp;rsquo;s on the GPU, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Absolutely. If we create this entire animation of moving the lantern in some direction, as if slightly moved by wind, inside the shader, then it means the geometry when placed in the world can remain Static. When it remains static it means our draw calls are back to being easier to manage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My suggestion for getting that done would be to 0.0.0 your pivot point of the mesh to where the upper cable of the lantern is. Export like that and put into Unreal. In a special material shader for the lantern then, create a World Position Offset (WPO) that slightly rotates everything in whichever axis you like. If you add a little Sine animation multiplier to that, inside the WPO numbers, you will get exactly a bit of movement as if pushed by the wind. Apply that to all other lanterns now and they will all bundle into draw calls, as long as using the same material and their scale in the world is similar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you dislike the lantern movement being similar between all of them, you could introduce a bit of a random number multiplier in the shader to overcome it. Or you could expose a number that controls it, and in a material instance of the original parent put in your own animation offset as a number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you do that second option though, consider making just 3-4 material instances and then applying them to your 300-400 lanterns in the scene so they all end up in 3-4 draw calls. If you go out of your way to make a unique instance for each lantern then we are back to square one and we end up with all of them having a unique draw call (kind of bad).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know I quickly gloss over the last few tips, but I intend to give you the names of the techniques and resources you could look up online and I believe you can accomplish whatever it is you imagine using that. The tricky part is knowing, and being aware of it all in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is the part I struggled with the most before I joined the industry professionally. At my university for 3 years course not once were the words &amp;ldquo;draw calls&amp;rdquo; mentioned. When people talked about optimization everyone jumped to &amp;ldquo;oh well, its just too highpoly&amp;rdquo;. Though even back then I knew that clearly is not the case, it still took me years before I first realized about draw calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quite honestly, being in the industry now, I will tell you that even some professionals go for years unaware about draw calls. They talk and talk about lowpoly and highpoly but never consider their draw calls or implementing LODs to increase performance. But this would be a conversation for another time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As for now, if you are a student or someone getting into things just now, and in this blog you for the first time came across the concept of draw calls, then I take it this was helpful and the idea of it leaves me happy. Now go on and look up some more engine docs and videos on draw calls and supplement and increase your knowledge even more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
